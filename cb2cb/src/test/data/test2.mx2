There&apos;s something about baking with rum that&apos;s evocative of Merrie Olde England to me; I get pictures of revelers with muttonchops and cravats, toasting each other in front of a roaring fire with lots of mistletoe around, carolers outside, and a roast goose soon to appear. Interestingly enough, several tasters declared that the flavor of this cake&apos;s rum glaze instantly transported them to a beach under a palm tree, with steel drums in the background. Food is evocative stuff.

The original recipe I found for this cake needed some revision, and didn&apos;t include any raisins or chocolate chips. But when I included those extras in some of the versions I tested, they were both a big hit. This is a big cake: you could easily get 24 slices from it. If you&apos;re going to have a crowd
</DirT>
<DirT>
around for brunch or dinner, this cake is a good choice. —S.R.

For the cake: Preheat fhe oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt® pan. Combine the flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt in the bowl
</DirT>
<DirT>
of a mixer. Add the butter and mix on low speed until it&apos;s worked in completely; the mixture will have a sandy appearance.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a small bowl, combine the milk, rum, and eggs. Gradually add to the flour/butter mixture, with the mixture running at low speed. Once all of the liquid is in, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then increase
</DirT>
<DirT>
the mixer speed to medium and beat for 3 minutes. Stir in the pecans, and the chocolate chips or raisins, if using. Pour the batter into the pan, and
bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until the top of the cake springs back when lightly touched. Remove from the oven; place on a rack to cool for 10 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
For the glaze: In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Add the rum and butter; return to a simmer. Remove from the heat, and pour 3/4 cup of this syrup into a separate container to use for moistening the cake. To the remaining syrup in the pan, add the confectioners&apos; sugar 1/2 cup at a time, whisking
until blended and you have a thick, pourable glaze.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To finish the cake: After the cake has cooled for 10 minutes, invert it out of its pan onto a large plate. With a
wooden skewer or toothpick, pierce the cake all over. Brush the reserved rum syrup over the warm cake, repeating
as necessary until all of the syrup is used. Let the cake cool, then transfer it to a clean serving plate. Pour the confectioners&apos; sugar glaze over the top and sprinkle with the garnish pecans.
