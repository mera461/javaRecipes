MAKES 8 SERVINGS. PREP: 15 MIN., BAKE: 12 MIN.

Preheat oven to 400°. Separate biscuits into individual rounds. Pour olive oil onto a baking sheet. Dip both sides of each biscuit round in oil, and arrange on baking sheet. Using fingertips, press each biscuit into a 4-inch free-form flat circle. Sprinkle each flattened biscuit with 1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, and a pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake at 400° for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Cut into strips.

ROSEMARY-GARLIC BISCUIT FLATBREADS: Omit the Parmesan cheese and parsley, and then prepare the recipe as directed. Sprinkle the biscuits evenly with 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary and 2 minced garlic cloves.
