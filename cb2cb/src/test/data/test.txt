1/2 cup sliced ripe olives
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup (4 ounces) crumbled feta cheese

Place dough in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and divide in half. Roll each half of dough into a 10-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Place dough on baking sheets coated with cooking spray and each sprinkled with 1 tablespoon cornmeal.

Spread 2/3 cup Roasted Red Bell Pepper Sauce evenly over each prepared crust; top each with 1/3 cup sautéed onion, 1/4 cup olives, half of minced garlic, and 1/2 cup cheese. Bake at 450° for 15 minutes. Cut each pizza into 6 wedges.

DIR::
Trim fat from lamb; cut lamb into 3/4-inch cubes, and set aside.

Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray, and place over medium heat until hot. Add carrot and next 4 ingredients; cover and cook 5 minutes. Add lamb, and cook, uncovered, 3 minutes or until browned, stirring occasionally. Add beans and next 5 ingredients; stir well. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook, uncovered, 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Discard bay leaf.

Combine breadcrumbs, parsley, and garlic, and set aside.

Divide the lamb mixture between 2 (2-cup) individual casserole dishes coated with cooking spray, and top each casserole with 3 tablespoons breadcrumb mixture. Bake at 350° for 15 minutes.

What would a bistro menu be without cassoulet (ka-soo-LAY)? This upscale stew gained its name from the earthenware casserole it was usually cooked in. Our version includes the traditional navy beans, lamb, and tomatoes, but it doesn't take the traditional three days to make!
