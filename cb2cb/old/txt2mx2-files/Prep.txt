Each item below, when encountered in an ingredient line, should be moved to the prep column starting with the parenthesis.
The [ -- ] indicates 'Move to Prep'. So, the first part is what to search for, and the second part is what goes into the prep column.
Each of these is a case where parenthesis FOLLOWS the ingredient name. So, the rule is simply to move everything in parenthesis after an ingredient name into the prep column.
Some of these may be easier to do in NoteTab, but NoteTab cannot restrict its function to ingredients only.
If you need more complete examples of these, let me know. There will be many more examples, so it is best handled with a rule.
