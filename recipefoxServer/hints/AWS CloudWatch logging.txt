Security:
- Create a role (CloudWatchLog) as described here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/QuickStartEC2Instance.html
- Attach it to the EC2 instance

Install the agent:
- sudo yum install -y awslogs
- edit configs in /etc/awslogs/
- awscli.conf to set the CloudWatch region
[default]
region = us-west-2
- awslogs.conf
[RecipeFoxServer]
datetime_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
file = /home/ec2-user/recipefoxServer/logs/spring.log
buffer_duration = 5000
log_stream_name = i-0b3198c79b42c6f39
initial_position = start_of_file
log_group_name = RecipeFoxServer
- install as service
	- service awslogs start
	- sudo chkconfig awslogs on

- In CloudWatch logs
- Create a log group called RecipeFoxServer
- under that create a stream with the instance id: i-0b3198c79b42c6f39
- create metrics/alarms as needed.
