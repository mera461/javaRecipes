                    Aunt May's Pickled Green Tomatoes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Pickles/Relishes
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  15            pounds  green tomatoes -- sliced
  1                cup  pickling salt
     1/2    tablespoon  powdered alum
  2             quarts  boiling water
  2               cups  apple cider vinegar
  5               cups  sugar
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1                     handful of cloves

Arrange the tomatoes in layers in a large bowl or pickle crock, sprinkling salt between the layers.  Let stand overnight. 
The next day, drain tomatoes, sprinkle with alum, and pour the boiling water over them.  Let stand for 20 minutes.  Drain, rinse, and drain again. 
In an enamel or stainless steel kettle, combine vinegar, sugar and spices (tie the spices in a cheesecloth bag -- spice bag should be kept in the syrup right up to the very end).  Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and boil rapidly for 3 minutes.  Pour the syrup over the tomatoes and let stand overnight. 
Next day, drain off syrup and bring to a boil.  Pour over tomatoes and let stand again overnight. 
On the fourth day, put syrup and tomatoes into the kettle, bring to a boil and simmer until the tomatoes are transparent.  Pack the tomatoes into hot jars.  Boil the syrup until it becomes quite thick or spins a long thread.  Remove the spice bag and pour the syrup over the fruit, filling the jars, and seal. 
This recipe yields 8 quarts.

Categories    : Canning                         Chutneys
                Fruit

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  fresh blueberries -- rinsed, stemmed
  1             medium  onion -- finely chopped
  1 1/2           cups  red wine vinegar
     1/2           cup  golden raisins
     1/2           cup  brown sugar - (firmly packed)
  2          teaspoons  yellow mustard seed
  1         tablespoon  grated crystallized ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  salt
  1              pinch  ground nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  dried red pepper flakes

Place blueberries in 4-quart saucepan; add onion, vinegar, raisins, brown sugar, mustard seed, ginger, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg and red pepper flakes.  Bring mixture to a boil; simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 45 minutes, or until chutney is thick. 
Meanwhile, wash 4 half-pint jars.  Keep hot until needed.  Prepare lids as manufacturer directs. 
Ladle the hot chutney into 1 hot jar at a time, leaving 1/2-inch head space.  Wipe jar rim with a clean, damp cloth.  Attach lid.  Fill and close remaining jars.  Process in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes (20 minutes 1,001 to 3,000 feet; 25 minutes 3,001 to 6,000 feet; 30 minutes above 6,000 feet). 
This recipe yields 4 half-pint jars. 
Comments:  Try this chutney with roasted turkey, duck or goose, meat or curries.  Mixed with mayonnaise or plain yogurt it makes a piquant dressing for salads made with meat, poultry and fruits.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Chutneys


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  rhubarb -- trimmed weight
  1              pound  onions
     1/2         pound  raisins
     1/2         pound  sultanas
     1/2         ounce  coriander seeds
  2          teaspoons  curry powder
  6             ounces  granulated sugar
     3/4          pint  raspberry vinegar or red wine vinegar

Cut the trimmed rhubarb into short lengths and chop the onions quite finely.  Put both ingredients into a large pan and pour on the vinegar.  Then lightly bruise the whole coriander seeds.  Add the seeds direct to the pan if you want to include them in the chutney.  I love their spicy bite but some people complain that the seeds stick between their teeth, so you may prefer to tie them in a piece of buttermuslin and remove before potting. 
Bring the contents of the pan slowly to boiling point, cover and simmer gently for 20 minutes or so to start softening the onion.  Add the dried fruits, sugar, curry powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.  Stir to mix well.  Then continue simmering -- this time without a lid -- for 1 1/2 hours or so until the rhubarb has pulped down completely, the flavour is mellow, and the colour is rich and the consistency is thick.  Stir the chutney occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking, particularly towards the end. 
Pot in warm sterilized jars and allow to mature for at least one month before eating.  The longer you can resist eating this chutney the better it seems to taste.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  oranges or 3 grapefruit
                        Water -- to cover
  1            package  fruit flavored gelatin - (6 oz)
  2               cups  water
  1              stick  cinnamon
  10                    whole cloves
  2               cups  sugar

Wash oranges or grapefruit.  Make cuts in skin and pith from end to end, dividing the skin into four equal sections.  Remove peel and white pith in one piece from each section with fingers; reserve fruit for other use. 
Discard white portion of pith.  Cut peel (zest) into 1/4-inch strips, place in a large, heavy enamel or stainless steel saucepan with water to cover.  Boil, covered for 30 minutes or until peel can be easily pierced with a fork.  Drain. 
Mix gelatin with 2 cups water and spices, and add to fruit in saucepan.  Cover, bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer for about 50 minutes until syrup is almost absorbed, stirring frequently toward the end to prevent sticking. 
Lift out peel with tongs, and roll in pan sprinkled with sugar until heavily coated.  Cool on waxed paper and store in air-tight containers. 
This recipe yields about 72 candied peels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2              large  ruby or other variety grapefruit
  3             quarts  water -- plus
  2               cups  water
  1 1/2           cups  granulated sugar

Cut a thin slice from the top and the bottom of each grapefruit.  From the top to the bottom, cut through the outer skin and thick white pith to the fruit inside, spacing the cuts about 1 inch apart.  Peel the grapefruits, keeping the skin and pith together.  Cut each of the peel sections lengthwise into long strips 1/4-inch wide.  You will have about 3 cups.  Reserve the fruit for another use. 
Pour the 3 quarts water into a saucepan and add the peel strips.  Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium.  Cook, uncovered, until only an inch or so of water remains in the pan and set them aside in a bowl. 
In a stainless steel or other non reactive saucepan, combine the 2 cups water with 1 cup of the sugar.  Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Remove from the heat and stir the still warm peels into the syrup.  Let the peels stand for 6 or 7 hours at room temperature. 
Return the pan to low heat and cook the peels until they have absorbed all of the syrup, about 30 minutes.  The peels will become translucent and amber.  During the last stages of cooking, keep a close eye on the peels to prevent scorching or burning.  Remove the cooked peels from the pan and spread them in a single layer on a piece of aluminum foil or waxed paper.  They will be very sticky and supple.  Let the peels stand for about 12 hours to dry slightly. 
The next day, roll the peels, one by one, in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.  Leave them at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours to dry.  Pack the candied peels into covered tins, boxes, or glass jars in layers separated by waxed paper.  Store in a cool, dry place.  The peels will keep for up to 2 months.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Pickles/Relishes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             medium  to large cucumbers - (to 6)
  4             medium  sweet red peppers
  4             medium  green peppers
  1                cup  chopped onion
  2          teaspoons  turmeric
     1/2           cup  pure granulated salt
  1         tablespoon  mustard seed
  2           teaspoon  whole cloves
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1              quart  vinegar
  1 1/2           cups  brown sugar - (firmly packed)

Organize ingredients, equipment, and work area.  Scrub cucumbers and cut off stem and blossom end.  Chop cucumbers.  Stem, seed, and chop peppers. 
You should have 2 quarts chopped cucumbers and 2 cups of each color of chopped peppers.  Combine them with onion in a large mixing bowl; sprinkle the vegetables with turmeric. 
Dissolve salt in 2 quarts cold water; pour over vegetables.  Let stand for 3 to 4 hours.  Drain vegetables thoroughly.  Cover them again with cold water and  let stand another hour.  Drain well. 
Tie the spices in a cheesecloth bag and put in a large preserving kettle with the vinegar and sugar.  Heat to boiling, then pour over the vegetables.  Cover and set aside in a cool place for several hours or overnight. 
Slowly heat the vegetables and syrup to boiling, then pack relish into hot jars to within 1/4-inch of tops.  Run a slim, non metal tool down along insides of jars to release any air bubbles.  Add additional relish, if necessary, to bring to within 1/4-inch of tops. 
Wipe tops and threads of the jars with a damp clean cloth.  Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.  Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. 
This recipe yields 6 pint jars of relish. 
Comments:  Bright with red and green peppers, this recipe is a good way to use cucumbers that grew too big to pickle.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  cooked fresh whole kernel corn -- (abt 12 ears)
  3               cups  chopped cabbage
  1                cup  chopped onion
  1             medium  green bell pepper -- chopped
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- chopped
  4               cups  Heinz distilled white vinegar
  2               cups  granulated sugar
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  pickling salt
  1         tablespoon  celery seed
  1         tablespoon  mustard seed
  1         tablespoon  turmeric
  1                     bay leaf

In a 6- to 8-quart sauce pot, combine all ingredients.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove bay leaf. 
Immediately fill hot pint or half-pint Ball jars with mixture, leaving 1/2-inch head space.  Carefully run a nonmetallic utensil down inside of jars to remove trapped air bubbles. 
Wipe jar tops and threads clean.  Adjust two piece caps.  Process pints or half-pints in boiling water canner for 15 minutes. 
This recipe yields 5 to 6 pints or 10 to 12 half-pints.

                       Crab Apple-Hot Pepper Jelly

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Jams/Jellies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  crab apples
  1 1/2           cups  water
                        red wine vinegar
  3 3/4           cups  granulated sugar
  1                cup  sweet green peppers
     1/3           cup  hot peppers - (to 1 cup) -- see * Note

* Note:  Recipe recommends 1/3 cup if using fiery variety -- up to 1 cup of piquant to medium-hot peppers may be used. 
Crab apple pectin gives a good set to this hot pepper jelly.  Mix and match hot peppers for colour and degree of heat.  Banana peppers range from piquant to medium-hot.  Cherry peppers and long, skinny green chili peppers are fiery.  When chopping hot peppers, wear gloves and don't touch your face or eyes. 
In Dutch oven, combine apples with water.  Cover and bring slowly to simmer; cook until apples are very soft.  Pour into colander lined with square of dampened muslin and placed over deep bowl.  Weight down with saucer and heavy can.  Let stand until dripping stops.  Discard pulp. 
Pour collected juice into liquid measure; add enough vinegar to make 3 cups.  Combine in saucepan with sugar.  Bring to boil, stirring.  Add peppers; boil briskly for 8 to 10 minutes or until set.  (To test for set: remove pan from heat, dip cold metal spoon into liquid and hold well above steam.  Turn spoon sideways and let liquid run off; when it forms two drops that run together and drip from edge of spoon, jelling point is reached.)  Stir for several minutes to prevent floating peppers. 
Pour jelly into hot, sterilized 8-ounce preserving jars.  Seal with two-piece canning lids.  Let cool and refrigerate.  For long-term unrefrigerated storage, process in boiling-water bath for 5 minutes immediately after sealing jars. 
This recipe yields 6 half-pint jars.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  raspberries - (3 pints)
  2 1/2           cups  sugar
  3               cups  cranberries - (12 oz bag)
     1/4           cup  fresh orange juice
                        Grated zest of 1 orange

Stir together the raspberries and 1 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl and let stand for 1 hour. 
Stir the cranberries and the remaining sugar together in a nonreactive shallow preserving pan and place over high heat.  Stir constantly so the sugar does not burn until the cranberries begin to release juice, about 5 minutes.  Continue cooking until all the cranberries have popped and the mixture is syrupy and comes to a boil.  Skim off any foam that forms on top and continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes more. 
Add the raspberries and all their juice and cook for 10 minutes more Stir in the orange juice and zest.  Remove a small amount of the jam to a saucer and place in the freezer for 5 minutes.  If the mixture wrinkles when pushed to one side, it is ready.  If not, continue cooking for 5 minutes and retest. 
When the preserves are the right consistency, turn down the heat to a simmer and ladle into hot sterilized jars.  Wipe the rims clean with a damp towel and seal with new lids and metal rings.  Process in a hot-water bath for 5 minutes.  Remove, check seals, label, and store. 
This recipe yields 4 pints.

                             Dandelion Jelly

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Jams/Jellies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              quart  dandelion blossoms
  2             quarts  water
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1 3/4         ounces  powdered fruit pectin
  5 1/2           cups  sugar

Pick bright, fresh dandelion blossoms and pack the quart container pretty tightly.  This is going to require a lot of dandelion blossoms!  Rinse quickly in cold water to remove any insects/dirt on the petals.  Don't leave the blossoms in the water for very long though, as they will be a little the worse for wear. 
Next, pull up a chair somewhere comfortable, as this part is going to take awhile... Snip off the stem and green collar under each blossom, so that only the petals are left.  This takes about four hours! 
In an enamel saucepan, boil the dandelion petals in water for 3 to 4 minutes, or a little longer, until the water takes on their color. 
Cool and strain, pressing against the petals with your fingers to extract all of the dandelion juice.  (Or you can cheat and line a sieve with moistened cheesecloth and strain it that way.) 
Measure out 3 cups of dandelion liquid.  Add the lemon juice and fruit pectin.  Stir to combine.  Bring to a boil, using a large kettle.  Add the sugar, stirring to mix well.  Continue stirring and boil the mixture for 2 1/2 minutes. 
Pour into hot sterilized jelly jars and seal.  Process for five minutes in a boiling water bath. 
This recipe yields 5 half-pint jars.

Categories    : Canning                         Pickles/Relishes


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  pickling salt
  2             quarts  cold water
  4               cups  chopped cabbage
  2               cups  chopped white onions
  2               cups  chopped red bell peppers
  2               cups  chopped green bell peppers
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  mustard seed
  2        tablespoons  celery seed
  4               cups  cider vinegar

In a large bowl, dissolve salt in water.  Stir in cabbage, onions and bell peppers.  Let stand at room temperature 3 hours.  Drain thoroughly. 
In a medium-size bowl, combine sugar, mustard and celery seeds and vinegar, stirring until sugar dissolves.  Pour over vegetables.  Let stand overnight. 
Thoroughly wash and scald 4 (1-pint) jars.  Keep hot until needed.  Prepare lids as manufacturer directs. 
In a large kettle,bring vegetables and liquid to boiling, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat.  Immediately ladle into hot jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace.  Remove air bubbles by running a table knife inside edge of jar.  Wipe jar rims; seal with hot lids and screw bands.  Process 15 minutes in a simmering water bath. 
This recipe yields 3 to 4 pints. 
Comments:  Maybeth Wilson's eye-catching relish stands out because of its bright color and crisp texture.  Instead of grinding the vegetables, she chops them by hand, so each one retains its identity.

Comments:  Maybeth Wilson&apos;s eye-catching relish stands out because of its bright color and crisp texture.  Instead of grinding the vegetables, she chops them by hand, so each one retains its identity.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Marmalades


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  eggplant
  4               cups  sugar - (2 lbs)
  4               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  ground nutmeg
  1 1/2      teaspoons  ground cinnamon
                        Juice of 2 large lemons
                        Grated rind of 1/2 lemon

Wash, peel and dice the eggplant.  Barely cover with water in a preserving kettle and boil for about 10 minutes; drain and set aside.  Make a syrup by combining the sugar, water, nutmeg and cinnamon and bringing them to a boil.  Add the eggplant.  Remove from heat, cover and allow to stand overnight. 
The next day, remove the eggplant with a slotted spoon and boil the syrup for 20 minutes to thicken it.  Return the eggplant to the kettle and boil for 30 to 40 minutes until the syrup sheets when dropped from a spoon (2 drops forming on the edge of the spoon, coming together and falling as 1 drop), or until a jelly thermometer reads 220 to 222 degrees.  Stir in the lemon juice and grated rind.  Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and seal. 
To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe the rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all particles of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover with a 1/8-inch layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add another layer of melted paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to seal completely. 
This recipe yields about 8 half-pints.

  1             gallon  water
     1/4           cup  pickling salt
  4               cups  distilled white vinegar
  2               cups  water
  6               cups  sugar
  4          teaspoons  mustard seed
  4          teaspoons  celery seed
  1                can  crushed pineapple - (15 1/4 oz)
  2        tablespoons  dry mustard
  1         tablespoon  turmeric
  1                cup  all-purpose flour

Combine vegetables in a large bowl.  Mix 1 gallon water and pickling salt; pour over vegetables.  Let stand overnight. 
Thoroughly  wash and scald 11 (1-pint) jars.  Keep hot until needed.  Prepare lids as manufacturer directs. 
In a large kettle, bring vegetables and water to a boil.  Drain vegetables thoroughly.  Wash kettle; combine vegetables, vinegar, 2 cups water, sugar and mustard and celery seeds.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. 
Meanwhile, drain pineapple juice into a glass measure, reserving fruit.  In a small bowl, mix dry mustard, tumeric and flour.  Using a wire whisk, slowly add pineapple juice and enough liquid from hot vegetable mixture to make a thin smooth paste.  Carefully add mustard paste, a little at a time, to hot vegetable mixture, stirring constantly.  Stir in reserved pineapple.  Simmer until relish has thickened slightly, stirring constantly. 
Remove from heat.  Immediately ladle into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace.  Wipe jar rims; seal with hot lids and screw bands.  Process 10 minutes in a simmering water bath. 
This recipe yields 11 pints. 
Comments:  Jan Wagner's mustardy relish is like a premium version of the commercial product.

                         Framboise Raspberry Jam

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Jams/Jellies


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  fresh raspberries
  3               cups  sugar
     1/4           cup  framboise

Place all ingredients in heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.  When mixture comes to a boil, raise heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, for about 20 minutes.  As mixture begins to thicken, watch carefully to prevent sticking. 
When mixture has reached a jam-like consistency, immediately remove from heat.  Pour into hot sterilized jars and vacuum seal (hot water bath method, or can be refrigerated up to 6 weeks). 
This recipe yields 4 half-pint jars. 
Comments:  The combination of the delicacy of fresh raspberries and the mellow framboise (raspberry brandy) makes a remarkable jam.  Use both as a spread and as a dessert garnish.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  finely-chopped fresh garlic
  2               cups  white wine vinegar
  5 1/2           cups  sugar
  3               cups  water

     1/4      teaspoon  butter or oil
  2              drops  food coloring -- (optional)

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Fruit
                Jams/Jellies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             quarts  firm ripe small strawberries
     1/2           cup  fresh lemon juice
  6 2/3           cups  sugar

Combine strawberries and sugar in a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven, and allow to stand for 3 to 4 hours.  Over medium-low heat, bring mixture slowly to a boil, and stir until sugar is thoroughly dissolved.  Add the lemon juice, and increase heat to high.  Boil rapidly until strawberries are transparent and syrup is thick (about 12 minutes). 
Remove from heat, and skim any foam from surface of mixture.  With a slotted spoon, remove the strawberries from the syrup and place in a shallow container.  Return the syrup to heat, bring to a boil and cook for 8 minutes.  Pour hot syrup over strawberries.  Cover container loosely with a clean towel, and allow to stand in a cool place for at least 12 and not more than 24 hours. 
Skim any foam from surface.  Do not stir mixture, but shake it occasionally so strawberries absorb the syrup and are distributed evenly.  Pour into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space.  Adjust jar caps, and process for 20 minutes in boiling water. 
This recipe yields about 5 half-pints.

                          Habenero Pepper Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Sauces


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12                    habenero peppers -- stemmed, chopped
  1         tablespoon  vegetable oil
     1/2           cup  chopped carrots
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
     1/2           cup  distilled vinegar
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  lime juice

Saute the onion and garlic in oil until soft; add the carrots with a small amount of water.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until carrots are soft. 
Place the mixture and raw chilies into a blender and puree until smooth.  Don't cook the peppers, since cooking reduces flavor of the Habeneros. 
Combine the puree with vinegar and lime juice, then simmer for 5 minutes and seal in sterilized bottles. 
This recipe yields 2 half-pints. 
Heat index:  Sauce is 9 on a scale of 1-10.

                        Preserved Lemons Or Limes

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Fruit


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         dozen  lemons
                        (or a mixture of lemons and limes)
                        Salt -- as needed
                        Paprika -- as needed
                        Vegetable or very light olive oil -- as needed

Place lemons (or mix of lemons and limes) in freezing compartment overnight.  The next day scrub and slice them.  Sprinkle with salt and leave in a colander to drain and soften.  This can take several hours or longer depending on the weather.  Arrange the slices in layers in a glass jar, sprinkling each layer with paprika.  Cover completely with oil.  They are ready in about a month when they are soft and a beautiful warm golden color.  Store in a cool, dry place. 
This recipe yields 6 preserved lemons. 
For an alternative method of preserving lemons:  Take as many lemons or limes as you wish to preserve.  Stud each with 6 cloves.  Pierce the skins with a skewer to save your thumbs.  Place in a glass jar and cover completely with oil or white vinegar.  Keep cool.  They will be ready in 3 to 4 weeks. 
Salt-Preserved Lemons:  Scrub the wax off of the lemons or use unwaxed and merely wash them.  Dry thoroughly.  Slice the lemon lengthwise into quarters, but not all the way to the bottom.  The quarters should still be joined.  Place in a large clean dry glass/glazed ceramic jar and pack salt around and in the lemons.  It takes a fair amount of salt so don't be stingy.  Make certain they are covered by salt and cap the jar.  Leave in the fridge or on a shelf in a cool place for at least two weeks, four weeks seems to be ideal but various people do it various ways.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            medium  green tomatoes - (to 16)
  3             medium  sweet red peppers
  3             medium  green peppers
  2              large  onions - (to 3)
  2             pounds  cabbage
     1/3           cup  salt
  3 1/2           cups  vinegar
  1 1/2           cups  brown sugar
  2        tablespoons  whole mixed pickling spice
  2                     cinnamon sticks
  1         tablespoon  whole cloves
  4              whole  allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg

Stem tomatoes; stem and seed peppers.  Peel and cut onions into quarters.  Cut cabbage into chunks.  Put all vegetables through coarse blade of food grinder or chop coarsely. 
In large mixing bowl, combine vegetables and salt.  Set bowl aside and let stand several hours or overnight. 
Line a large sieve or colander with cheesecloth and pour in the vegetables.  Drain well, then lift edges of the cheesecloth and squeeze to press out the liquid. 
Organize ingredients, equipment, and work space.  Combine vinegar and sugar in large preserving kettle.  Tie whole spices in a cheesecloth bag and add to the kettle.  Stir in ground spices.  Heat to boiling.  Add drained vegetables and heat to boiling.  Reduce heat and simmer about 30 minutes, or until vegetables begin to get juicy. 
Remove the spice bag.  Ladle into hot jars to within 1/4-inch of tops.  Run a slim, non metal tool down along the insides of jars to release any air bubbles.  Add additional relish, if necessary, to fill to within 1/4-inch of tops. 
Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.  Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.  Process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. 
This recipe yields 4 pints. 
Comments:  The sweet and sour taste of this relish makes it a favorite for hot dogs or company roasts.

                           Quick Pickled Beets

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Pickles/Relishes                Refrigerator
                Vegetables

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5              small  or 3 large beets
  1              large  white or yellow onion
  1 1/4           cups  white vinegar - (10 oz)
     3/4           cup  canola (vegetable) oil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1                     clean quart-size glass jar

Cook the beets and slip them out of their skins.  Slice into 1/4-inch rounds and set aside.  Peel and slice onion into 1/4-inch rounds. 
Layer beets and onion in jar, alternating beet/onion/beet/onion, sprinkling salt and pepper between layers.  When layers have reached top of jar, pour oil and vinegar over.  Cap tightly and store in refrigerator -- they will keep for months. 
This recipe yields ?? 
Comments:  Beautiful served in a glass bowl at the dinner table, also make a very nice snack with fresh bread (like rye) and a glass of beer.  Serve hot, quartered beets for dinner garnished with 2 tablespoons of crumbled blue cheese and a tablespoon of toasted walnuts.  (That amount serves 2 to 3.)  The flavors are wonderfully complementary.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Canning                         Fruit
                Jams/Jellies

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fully ripe peaches
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice
  1           teaspoon  fruit protector -- (optional)
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  cloves
  5 1/2           cups  sugar
  1                box  fruit pectin
     1/2      teaspoon  margarine or butter

Peel, pit and finely chop peaches.  Measure 4 cups into 6- or 8 quart sauce pot.  Stir in lemon juice, fruit protector and spices.  Measure sugar into separate bowl.  (Scrape excess sugar from cup with spatula to level for exact measure.)  Stir fruit pectin into fruit in sauce pot.  Add margarine.  Bring to full rolling boil on high heat, stirring constantly.  Quickly stir in all sugar.  Return to full rolling boil and boil exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Remove  from heat.  Skim off any foam with metal spoon.  Ladle quickly into hot sterilized jars, filling to within 1/8-inch of  tops.  Wipe jar rims and threads.  Cover with two piece lids.  Screw  bands tightly.  Invert jars 5 minutes, then turn upright.  After jars are cool, check seals.  Or follow water bath method recommended by USDA. 
This recipe yields about 7 half-pint jars. 
Comments:  Great as a glaze for roasted poultry or pork.  Great as a sauce -- just heat and serve.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  small pickling cucumbers
                        === BRINING SOLUTION ===
  1              quart  distilled white vinegar
  3        tablespoons  pickling salt
  1         tablespoon  mustard seed
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        === CANNING SYRUP ===
  1 2/3           cups  distilled white vinegar
  3               cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  whole allspice
  2 1/4      teaspoons  celery seed

Wash cucumbers, remove any blemishes, nip off stems and blossom ends and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. 
In large enameled or stainless steel kettle, mix together ingredients for brining solution and add cut cucumbers.  Cover and simmer until cucumbers change from bright to dull green (about 5 to 7 minutes).  Meanwhile, combine canning syrup ingredients in enameled kettle and bring to boil. 
Drain cucumber slices and pack them, still piping hot, in hot 1-pint canning jars.  Cover them with very hot syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headroom.  Run a chopstick or nonmetal spatula around insides of jars to remove air bubbles.  Adjust lids.  Pack and add hot syrup to 1 jar at a time, returning syrup kettle to low heat between filling and capping each jar, so syrup doesn't cool. 
Process filled and capped jars in hot water bath for 10 minutes.  Remove jars immediately and let sit on counter until cool.  Press middle of each cap; if it does not bounce back, jar is sealed.  If it does pop back, either store jar in refrigerator and eat soon, or reprocess with new cap. 
This recipe yields ??

Wash cucumbers, remove any blemishes, nip off stems and blossom ends and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.

In large enameled or stainless steel kettle, mix together ingredients for brining solution and add cut cucumbers.  Cover and simmer until cucumbers change from bright to dull green (about 5 to 7 minutes).  Meanwhile, combine canning syrup ingredients in enameled kettle and bring to boil.

Drain cucumber slices and pack them, still piping hot, in hot 1-pint canning jars.  Cover them with very hot syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headroom.  Run a chopstick or nonmetal spatula around insides of jars to remove air bubbles.  Adjust lids.  Pack and add hot syrup to 1 jar at a time, returning syrup kettle to low heat between filling and capping each jar, so syrup doesn&apos;t cool.

Process filled and capped jars in hot water bath for 10 minutes.  Remove jars immediately and let sit on counter until cool.  Press middle of each cap; if it does not bounce back, jar is sealed.  If it does pop back, either store jar in refrigerator and eat soon, or reprocess with new cap.
