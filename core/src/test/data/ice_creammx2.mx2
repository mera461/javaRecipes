  4                     ripe bananas
  1               tbsp  lemon juice
  7                 oz  vanilla sugar -- *
  8             ounces  milk
  8             ounces  evaporated skim milk
                        - orig was: whipping (heavy) cream

* (made by burying 3 or 4 vanilla pods in a container of sugar for at
least a week) 

Peel the bananas and cut into chunks. Put into a blender and blend with
the lemon juice and sugar, until smooth. Add the milk, and process again,
briefly. 

Stir in the cream, then immediately freeze in a freezer-proof container.
Either still-freeze or use an ice-cream making machine. 

If you wish to still-freeze, put the container in the freezer, and let the
ice-cream freeze. When it is half-frozen (approximately 4 hours, but could
be sooner or later depending on your freezer), take out the container,
quickly run the contents through a liquidizer or food processor, and
return to the container, and to the freezer. Repeat after another few
hours.

Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  ripe peaches -- finely chopped
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
     1/2                juice of lemon
  2              large  eggs
  2               cups  heavy or whipping cream
  1                cup  milk

The best way to capture the elusive flavor of summertime. Ben and Jerry
prefer small peaches because they have more flavor and less water than the
larger ones. Combine the peaches, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the lemon
juice in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, stirring the mixture
every 30 minutes. Remove the peaches from the refrigerator and drain the
juice into another bowl. Return the peaches to the refrigerator. Whisk the
eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the
remaining 3/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until
completely blended, about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and milk and
whisk to blend. Add the peach juice and blend. Transfer the mixture to an
ice cream maker and freeze following manufacturer's instructions. After
the ice cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before if is done) add the
peaches, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready. Makes 1

The best way to capture the elusive flavor of summertime. Ben and Jerry prefer small peaches because they have more flavor and less water than the larger ones. Combine the peaches, 1/2 cup of the sugar, and the lemon juice in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, stirring the mixture every 30 minutes. Remove the peaches from the refrigerator and drain the juice into another bowl. Return the peaches to the refrigerator. Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more. Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend. Add the peach juice and blend. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze following manufacturer&apos;s instructions. After the ice cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before if is done) add the peaches, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready. Makes 1 generous quart.

NOTES : The real secret to Ben & Jerry's ice cream is its consistency.  It
                is a thick and creamy ice cream developed with special
        equipment         that keeps a great deal of air out of the
        mixture.  The less air         in the ice cream, the thicker the
        consistency.  Therefore, you may         find the above recipes
        fills your ice cream maker a little more         than other ice
        cream recipes.        It's also important to get the right
        consistency of Heath bar         chunks.  Most of the candy bar
        should be crushed into crumbs, but         stop breaking the candy
        when there are still several 1- and         1/2-inch chunks
        remaining.        Try substituting othe ringredients for the Heath
        bar chunks, just         as Ben and Jerry have.  Try Reese's
        Peanut Butter Cups, Oreo         cookies, Kit Kat bars, Rollo
        cups, M&Ms, and chunks of raw cookie         dough.

     1/4           cup  White chocolate -- ; chop coarse
     1/4           cup  Semisweet chocolate -- ; chop
     1/4           cup  Pecan halves -- ; chopped
     1/4           cup  Walnuts -- ; chop coarse
     1/4           cup  Chocolate covered almonds -- ; - cut in half
  4                 oz  Unsweetened chocolate
  1                cup  Milk
  2              large  Eggs
  1                cup  Sugar
  1                cup  Heavy or whipping cream
  1                tsp  Vanilla extract
  1              pinch  Salt

Combine the coarsely chopped chocolate, pecans, walnuts and chocolate
covered almonds in a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Melt the unsweetened
chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling water. Whisk
in the milk, a little at a time, and heat, stirring constantly, until
smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool. Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl
until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Whisk in the sugar, a little at a
time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute
more.
Add the cream, vanilla and salt and whisk to blend. Pour the chocolate
mixture into the cream mixture and blend. Cover and refrigerate until
cold,
about 1-3 hours, depending on your refrigerator. Transfer the cream
mixture
to an ice cream maker and freeze following the manufacturer's
instructions.
After the ice cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before it is done), add the
chocolate and nuts, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready.
Makes one Generous Quart. Note: "New York Super Fudge Chunk was developed
as a regional flavor for the sophisticated New York palate. After coming
up
with several variations in our Burlington lab,we packed the samples in dry
ice and shipped them by bus to our New York consultants, a group of
musicians on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Following several weeks of
refinement and discussion, we all agreed on this final recipe- a chocolate
lover's dream."

Transfer the cream mixture&#013;&#010;to an ice cream maker and freeze following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.&#013;&#010;After the ice cream stiffens (about 2 minutes before it is done), add the&#013;&#010;chocolate and nuts, then continue freezing until the ice cream is ready.&#013;&#010;Makes one Generous Quart. Note: &quot;New York Super Fudge Chunk was developed&#013;&#010;as a regional flavor for the sophisticated New York palate. After coming up&#013;&#010;with several variations in our Burlington lab,we packed the samples in dry&#013;&#010;ice and shipped them by bus to our New York consultants, a group of&#013;&#010;musicians on Manhattan&apos;s Upper West Side. Following several weeks of&#013;&#010;refinement and discussion, we all agreed on this final recipe- a chocolate&#013;&#010;lover&apos;s dream.&quot;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;

  4               cups  picked over blueberries
  1                cup  sugar
                        the zest of 1 navel orange -- removed in strips --

Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  crumbs from brown soda bread or crustless
                        -- whole wheat bread
  14       tablespoons  sugar
  3        tablespoons  dark brown sugar -- (packed)
     2/3           cup  whole milk
  1              piece  vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
                        -- (3-inch)
  2              large  egg yolks
  1 1/3           cups  chilled whipping cream
  2                     baskets strawberries -- hulled, sliced
                        -- (1-pint)

Preheat oven to 375F.  Line baking sheet with foil; butter foil.  Mix
breadcrumbs, 3 tablespoons sugar and brown sugar in medium bowl.  Scatter
over prepared baking sheet.  Bake until sugar begins to melt and crumbs
are slightly darker, stirring crumbs occasionally with metal spatula to
prevent sticking, about 10 minutes.  Transfer breadcrumbs to bowl and
cool.  Break crumbs into small pieces.

Place milk in medium saucepan.  Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; add
bean.  Bring to simmer.  Remove from heat and let steep 30 minutes.

Whisk egg yolks and 5 tablespoons sugar in large bowl to blend.  Gradually
whisk in milk mixture.  Return mixture to same saucepan.  Stir over low
heat until custard thickens and leaves path on back of spoon when finger
is drawn across, about 5 minutes (do not boil).  Strain into small bowl. 
Chill custard until cold, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour.

Beat whipping cream in large bowl until firm peaks form.  Fold custard
into cream.  Gently fold into breadcrumbs.  Transfer to covered containers
and freeze.  (Can be prepared 3 days ahead.  Keep frozen.)

Combine strawberries and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl. 
Let stand until juices form, about 20 minutes.  Scoop ice cream into
bowls.  Spoon strawberries and juices over and serve.

Serves 6 to 8.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  half-n-half
  1                cup  whipping cream
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  peach preserves -- (not jelly)
  1                     vanilla bean -- split and scraped
  1              pinch  kosher salt
  4             medium  peaches -- halved, seeded and
                        -- grilled or broiled
                        -- until brown

Combine all ingredients (including the bean and its pulp) in a large sauce
pan and place over medium heat.  Attach a frying or candy thermometer to
inside of pan.  (see note below) Stirring occasionally, bring the mixture
to 170 degrees F.  Remove from heat and strain into a lidded container. 
Cool mixture, then refrigerate mixture overnight to mellow flavors and
texture.

Freeze mixture in ice cream freezer according to unit's instructions.  The
mixture will not freeze hard in the machine.  Meanwhile, chop peaches
roughly.  Once the volume has increased by 1/2 and reached a soft serve
consistency, add the peaches and continue turning to incorporate.  Spoon
the mixture back into a lidded container and harden in the freezer at
least 1 hour before serving.

NOTE: If you do not have a thermometer, bring the mixture just barely to a
simmer.  As soon as you see a bubble his the surface, remove it from the
heat.  Do not let it boil.

Yield: About a quart and a half

Once the volume has increased by 1/2 and reached a soft serve consistency, add the peaches and continue turning to incorporate.  Spoon the mixture back into a lidded container and harden in the freezer at least 1 hour before serving.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;NOTE: If you do not have a thermometer, bring the mixture just barely to a simmer.  As soon as you see a bubble his the surface, remove it from the heat.  Do not let it boil.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Yield: About a quart and a half&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Converted by MC_Buster.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;

  1 1/4             lb  Medium bananas -- unpeeled

  1                  c  Semisweet chocolate chips
  2                  c  Heavy cream

  EQUIPMENT: Measuring cup, measuring spoons, 2
  stainless steel bowls (1 large), slotted spoon, film
  wrap, 2 1/2-qt saucepan, whisk, electric mixer with
  paddle, rubber spatula, instant-read test thermometer,
  ice-cream freezer, 2-qt plastic container with lid
  
  Peel the bananas. Using a slotted spoon, smash them to
  a rough-textured consistency in a stainless steel
  bowl. Cover with film wrap and set aside.
  
  Place 1/2 cup of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2
  1/2-qt saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the
  sugar will resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar
  for 5 to 6 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring
  constantly with a whisk to break up any lumps (the
  sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then
  light brown as it caramelizes). Reduce the heat to
  medium.
  
  Carefully and slowly pour the heavy cream, then the
  half-and-half into the caramelized sugar (the mixture
  will steam and boil rapidly as the cream is added).
  Add 1/2 cup of sugar and whisk to dissolve. Bring to a
  boil, about 5 minutes.

  1                     vanilla bean
  1                cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  water
  1 1/2           cups  whipping cream
  1                cup  whole milk
  8              large  egg yolks

Split vanilla bean in half lengthwise.  Scrape seeds into large saucepan;
add bean.  Add sugar and 1/4 cup water and stir over medium-low heat until
sugar dissolves.  Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup
turns deep amber color, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet
pastry brush and swirling pan, about 8 minutes.

Remove from heat.  Add cream (mixture will bubble vigorously).  Stir over
low heat until any caramel bits dissolve, about 4 minutes.  Add milk;
bring to simmer.  Whisk yolks in large bowl to blend.  Gradually whisk
caramel mixture into yolks.  Return custard to saucepan and stir over
medium-low heat until custard thickens and leaves path on spoon when
finger is drawn across, about 5 minutes (do not boil).  Strain custard
into large bowl; refrigerate until cold.

Process custard in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's

                             Cashew Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Karen Cross Whyte
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           Teaspoon  Agar -- granules
                        Or
  2        Tablespoons  Agar -- flakes
  2 1/2           Cups  Water
     3/4           Cup  Cashew Butter
     1/4           Cup  Honey
  1           Teaspoon  Vanilla
  1         Tablespoon  Lemon Juice

Put the agar and water in a saucepan and heat until agar granules are
dissolved. Agar flakes may require simmering several minutes before they
are ready; follow the directions on the jar. When agar water is ready,
remove from the heat and cool to lukewarm. Put agar water and remaining
ingredients into a blender and whip for one minute. Pour the mixture into
an ice cream freezer. Following the freezer instructions, freeze until
firm. Store ice cream in the refrigerator freezer until ready to serve.

VARIATIONS: Omit one cup of water and add one cup of fruit pulp just
before pouring into the freezer. Bananas, strawberries, or peaches make
excellent fruit-flavored ice creams. For carob ice cream, add 1/4 cup
carob flour. Add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans for a delicious flavor
and a crunchy texture. Substitute any kind of nut or seed butter for
cashew butter.

Take the chocolate cookie dough out of refrigerator and leave out till
needed.
Scald milk until bubbles form around edge. Remove from heat. Add sugar and
salt. Stir until dissolved. Stir in half and half, vanilla, and whipping
cream.
Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes. Freeze as directed by your ice cream
machine's instructions. Once ice cream has been through the entire ice
cream machine process and is now a chilled soft ice cream, add the
chocolate chip cookie dough. Just break up the dough as best you can with
your hands and drop it in small clusters into the soft ice cream. Try to
mix it around to ensure that the cookie dough is evenly distributed
throughout the ice cream. Put the ice cream in the freezer for several
hours until hardened. Origin: We pretty much took our vanilla ice cream
recipe and added the chocolate chip cookie dough. You can easily use the
Pillsbury cookie dough, but it's cheaper and better to use homemade. Our

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  half and half
  6             ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- (about 1 1/3 cups) f
  5                     egg yolks
  1                cup  sugar
  1              Pinch  salt
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

In a medium saucepan, warm the half-and-half until bubbles form around the
edge of the pan. Set off the heat, stir in the chocolate until the mixture
is smooth and blended.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the yolks, sugar and salt until
blended. Gradually pour the chocolate cream into the yolk mixture,
whisking
constantly, until the liquid is fully incorporated.
Pour the mixture into the top pan of a double boiler and set the pan over
simmering water. Cook the sauce, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon,
until a finger drawn across the back of the spoon leaves a path, 10 to 12
minutes. (Do not let the sauce boil.)
Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl and stir in
the
vanilla. Nestle the bowl in the ice and stir the mixture occasionally
until
cool to the touch, about 30 minutes.
Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and process according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Transfer the ice cream to a chilled container
with a lid and freeze 3 to 4 hours before serving. Makes about 1 quart.

In a medium saucepan, warm the half-and-half until bubbles form around the&#013;&#010;edge of the pan. Set off the heat, stir in the chocolate until the mixture&#013;&#010;is smooth and blended.&#013;&#010;In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the yolks, sugar and salt until&#013;&#010;blended. Gradually pour the chocolate cream into the yolk mixture, whisking&#013;&#010;constantly, until the liquid is fully incorporated.&#013;&#010;Pour the mixture into the top pan of a double boiler and set the pan over&#013;&#010;simmering water. Cook the sauce, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon,&#013;&#010;until a finger drawn across the back of the spoon leaves a path, 10 to 12&#013;&#010;minutes. (Do not let the sauce boil.)&#013;&#010;Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl and stir in the&#013;&#010;vanilla. Nestle the bowl in the ice and stir the mixture occasionally until&#013;&#010;cool to the touch, about 30 minutes.&#013;&#010;Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and process according to the&#013;&#010;manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Transfer the ice cream to a chilled container&#013;&#010;with a lid and freeze 3 to 4 hours before serving. Makes about 1 quart.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;

                         Chocolate Ice Cream 101

Recipe By     :Martha Stewart
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole milk
  5              large  egg yolks
     1/4           cup  sugar -- plus
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream
  10            ounces  bittersweet chocolate -- melted

Bring milk to a simmer.  Meanwhile, combine egg yolks and sugar in the
bowl of an electric mixer.  Beat at medium-high speed until very thick and
pale yellow, 3 to 5 minutes.  Add half the milk to egg-yolk mixture and
whisk until blended.  Stir into remaining milk and cook over low heat,
stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat a spoon. 
Remove from heat and immediately stir in cream. 

Pass mixture through a strainer into a medium mixing bowl set in an ice
bath.  Whisk in melted chocolate and let chill, then freeze in an
ice-cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.  Store in a
plastic container in the freezer. 

Makes about 1 quart. 

Comments:  For especially intense flavor, use the best-quality chocolate
you can find - we like Valrhona.

Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  pitted prunes -- (about 6 ounces)
     1/3           cup  Armagnac
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  3              large  egg yolks
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  vanilla
  6             ounces  fine-quality bittersweet chocolate -- chopped coarse
  1 1/2           cups  well-chilled heavy cream

In a saucepan combine the prunes and 1/3 cup water and simmer the mixture 
for 5 to 7 minutes, or until almost all of the liquid is evaporated.  
Remove the pan from the heat, add the Armagnac, and let the prunes 
macerate for 3 hours.  Drain the prunes in a sieve set over a bowl, 
reserving the liquid, and chop them coarse.

In a bowl whisk together the sugar, the cornstarch, the yolks, and a pinch

of salt, add the milk, scalded, in a stream, whisking constantly with a 
wooden spoon.  Boil the custard, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, add 
the vanilla and the chocolate, and whisk the mixture until the chocolate 
is melted.  Transfer the custard mixture to a metal bowl set in a larger 
bowl of ice and cold water and let it cool, stirring.  Stir in the cream 
and the prunes with the reserved liquid and freeze according to the 
manufacturer's instructions.

Makes about 1 1/2 quarts.

Categories    : Ice Cream

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     Crepes -- see * Note
                        Melted unsalted butter
  1               pint  Vanilla ice cream
  2              large  Strawberries -- hulled, halved
                        lengthwise, halves sliced thin lengthwise

  * Note:  See the "Crepe Batter" recipe which is included in this 
collection.

   Arrange crepes, browner side down, on a work surface, fold them in half

and in half again to form triangles.  Lift the top flap of each triangle 
and put a large ball of foil inside to keep the cone open.  Brush the 
crepe cones with the butter and bake them on a baking sheet in a 400 
degree preheated oven for 4 minutes, or until they are crisp.  Remove the 
foil.
   For crepe cups:  Fit each crepe into an ovenproof 1 1/4-cup glass 
custard cup and put a large ball of foil in the center of each crepe to 
keep it open.  Bake the tulips on a jelly roll pan in a preheated 400 
degree oven for 5 minutes.  Remove the foil and bake for 2 to 3 minutes 
longer, or until they are crisp and golden.
   Fill cones or cups with a scoop of ice cream, and garnish with 
strawberry slices.
   This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
  1 1/2           cups  milk
  1                cup  Dulce de Leche Sauce*
  6                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1              pinch  salt

In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the cream, milk and 2/3 cup of the
dulce de leche, stirring constantly, until the mixture is blended and
steam
begins to rise from the surface, 4 to 5 minutes.
In a heatproof mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and salt
until blended.
Gradually add the hot cream mixture, whisking constantly until fully
incorporated.
Transfer the mixture to a clean saucepan and set over medium-low heat.
Cook, stirring slowly and continuously with a wooden spoon or spatula,
until
the custard thickens and a finger drawn across the back of the spoon
leaves
a path, 8 to 10 minutes. Do not allow the custard to boil.
Pour the custard through a fine-mesh sieve set over a clean bowl. Nestle
the
bowl in a larger one filled halfway with ice and water and cool the
custard
to room temperature, stirring occasionally.
Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
Transfer the custard to an ice cream maker and freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
At the end of the freezing stage, drizzle the remaining 1/3 cup dulce de
leche into the churning ice cream until it is just swirled throughout.
Transfer the ice cream to a chilled container, cover and freeze until
firm,
3 to 4 hours.
Makes about 1 quart.

Note* You can purchase Dulce de Leche Sauce in most supermarkets. Smuckers
also makes a Dulce de Leche Sauce.

                     Extra-rich Strawberry Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Recipe courtesy of Mary Goodbody
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar
  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract
  1              pinch  salt
  1                cup  half-and-half
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1               pint  strawberries

In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, vanilla, and salt.  Pour
the half-and-half and cream into the top of a double boiler and heat over
hot water until hot, but not boiling.  Stir with a wooden spoon, scraping
the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.  Slowly pour the hot cream into
the eggs and whisk until smooth.

Return to the double boiler and cook over medium-low until thick and
bubbling around the edges.  The custard will coat a wooden spoon.  Strain
the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a metal bowl.  Cover and chill
for at least 4 hours or overnight.

Rinse and hull the berries.  Roughly chop the berries and transfer half to
a small bowl.  Mash the other half with a fork or potato masher; they will
not be smooth but still a little chunky.  Add them to the chopped berries.
 Chill for at least 1 hour.

Pour the cream into the canister of an ice cream maker.  Freeze according
to manufacturers instructions.  When the ice cream is the consistency of
whipped cream, stir in the berries.  Transfer to a shallow quart
container, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze in the refrigerator's
freezer for at least 3 hours until ready to serve.  Let the ice cream sit
at room temperature for about 10 minutes before scooping.

This recipe yields 1 quart.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  heavy cream
  1                Cup  milk
     1/4           cup  sugar
  2                     Vanilla beans -- split lengthwise,
                        -- or
  2        tablespoons  vanilla extract
  4              large  egg yolks

NOTE:  To make a lighter ice cream, use 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of
cream.  To make a richer ice cream, add 2 more egg yolks.

 In a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan, heat cream, milk, sugar and vanilla
beans.  (If you're using vanilla extract, do not add it until later on in
the recipe.)  Stir occasionally until sugar is dissolved and mixture is
hot but not boiling.

 Whisk yolks together in bowl.  Continue whisking and very slowly pour in
about 1 cup of the cream mixture.  When smooth, pour back into to the
saucepan.

 Whisk constantly over low heat until mixture thickens slightly and coats
the back of a spoon (about 5 minutes).  Take care that mixture doesn't
boil, or it will curdle.  Draw your finger across the back of the coated
spoon.  If the line you make remains, custard is done.

 Remove vanilla beans; or is you're using vanilla extract, add it now.

 Freeze in ice cream churn according to manufacturer's instructions.

boil, or it will curdle.  Draw your finger across the back of the coated
spoon.  If the line you make remains, custard is done.

 Remove vanilla beans; or is you're using vanilla extract, add it now.

 Freeze in ice cream churn according to manufacturer's instructions.

Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3                     medium-size  ripe peaches -- peeled
                        pitted and
                        cut into 1/2-inch pieces -- (about 2 cups)
     1/2      teaspoon  juice from 1 lemon
  1              Pinch  salt
  1                cup  sugar -- plus
  6        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/4           cups  whole milk
  1 1/3           cups  heavy cream
  6              large  egg yolks
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract
  2        tablespoons  vodka

Makes about 1 quart.

Introduction :

When made with ripe, in-season peaches and a rich custard base, homemade
peach ice cream delivers an ultra-fresh, creamy-smooth sensation that
commercial brands can't match.

Both the cooked peaches and the custard mixture must be cooled to 40
degrees
before you churn them. Since they are fine in the refrigerator overnight,
you may want to prepare them the day before you plan to churn and serve
the
ice cream. You'll get the very best results from using in-season, fully
ripened peaches, but in a pinch, you can substitute 2 cups IQF
(individually
quick frozen) sliced peaches and replace the vodka with peach-flavored
liqueur (alcohol ensures the fruit's tenderness). The ice cream is at its
peak when eaten within four hours of churning.  Covered, it will keep in
the
freezer for up to two days.

1. Stir peaches, lemon juice, a pinch salt, and 1/2 cup sugar in
medium-size
nonreactive saucepan to combine; let stand until a pool of syrupy liquid
accumulates and peaches soften slightly, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

2. Position sieve over medium bowl set in an ice-water bath; set aside.
Heat
milk, cream, and 1/2 cup sugar in medium-size heavy saucepan over medium
heat, stirring occasionally, until steam appears, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn off
heat. Meanwhile, whisk yolks and remaining 6 tablespoons sugar in medium
bowl until pale yellow. Stir half the warmed milk mixture into beaten yolk
mixture until just blended. Return milk-yolk mixture to saucepan with
remaining warmed milk mixture. Heat milk-yolk mixture over medium-low
heat,
stirring constantly with wooden spoon, until steam appears, foam subsides,
and mixture just begins to thicken or instant-read thermometer registers
180
degrees. (During the early stages of cooking, there is a thin layer of
foam
on top of the custard. When the steam begins to rise from the custard and
the foam has almost totally subsided, it is near 180 degrees. The mixture
must not boil or the eggs will curdle.) Remove custard from heat, and pour
it through fine-mesh sieve into bowl placed over ice-water bath. Cool
custard mixture to room temperature, stir in vanilla, then cover and
refrigerate until instant-read thermometer registers 40 degrees, at
least 2 and up to 24 hours.

3. Meanwhile, heat softened peaches and their liquid, stirring
occasionally,
over medium-high heat, until peaches are tender and flesh has broken down,
3
to 4 minutes. Transfer to bowl, stir in vodka, and refrigerate until cold,
at least 4 and up to 24 hours.

4. Strain chilled peaches, reserving liquid. Stir reserved peach liquid
into
chilled custard mixture; pour into ice cream machine canister and churn,
following manufacturer's instructions, until mixture is frozen and
resembles
soft-serve ice cream, 25 to 30 minutes. Add peaches; continue to churn
until
combined, about 30 seconds longer. Transfer ice cream to airtight
container.
Freeze until firm, about 2 hours.

                             Ginger Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Sarah Pillsbury
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  milk
  1 3/4           cups  whipping cream
  2        tablespoons  minced ginger root
  4                     egg yolks
     1/2           cup  sugar

Scald milk, cream and ginger over high heat just until steam appears at
edge of pan.  Remove from heat and steep 1 hour.  Return to heat.  Whisk
together yolks and sugar until well-incorporated.  Pour small amount of
hot milk mixture into egg mixture, stirring well.  Slowly add egg mixture
to hot milk mixture, stirring constantly, and cook over high heat until
thickened enough that finger leaves trail on back of wooden spoon, about 3
minutes.  Strain into bowl.

Put bowl containing ice-cream base in bowl filled with ice and water and
stir constantly until cool.  Add more ice to water as it melts.  When
cool, freeze in ice-cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. 
Or make ice cream base several days ahead and, when cool, refrigerate
until ready to freeze in ice-cream maker.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

                      Gold Nugget Mandarin Ice Cream

Recipe By     :David Karp
Serving Size  : 13    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  mandarin juice
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  whipping cream
     1/2                vanilla bean -- split lengthwise
  1 1/4           cups  sugar
  10                    egg yolks

Cook the mandarin juice over medium heat until it is about 1 cup.  The
juice will darken in color and take on a light syrup consistency.  Be
careful because the juice will scorch as it gets closer to the right
consistency; pouring it into a smaller pot will help reduce the risk of
scorching.  When the juice is the right consistency, strain it into a
separate container and cool completely.

Heat the milk, cream, vanilla bean and half of the sugar, but do not bring
fully to a boil.  Beat the egg yolks and the rest of the sugar until pale
yellow.  Remove the vanilla bean from the liquid and scrape a few seeds
back into the mixture.

Gradually whisk 1/3 of the hot liquid into the egg yolks to temper them. 
Whisking constantly, add the tempered mixture back into the milk/cream
mixture.  Cook the mixture over a medium-low flame, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon to keep it from scorching.  When the mixture is thick
enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, it is the right consistency. 
Strain it into a bowl and cool it over an ice bath.

Add the reduced mandarin juice to the cooled ice cream base and freeze it
in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.

This recipe yields about 6 1/2 cups ice cream.

Each 1/2 cup:  282 calories;  43 mg sodium;  219 mg cholesterol;  19 grams
fat;  24 grams carbohydrates;  5 grams protein;  0.15 gram fiber.

Comments:  This recipe from Troy MacLarty, who cooks for the Culinary
Institute of America, and prepared this ice cream for a gala "Celebration
of Citrus" at UC Riverside last March.  He used Gold Nugget mandarins, the
University's newly released variety, but any flavorful mandarin will do. 
You can substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for the vanilla bean.

                            Lavender Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Martha Stewart
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole milk
  3        tablespoons  dried edible lavender flowers
  5              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream

In a medium saucepan, combine milk and lavender.  Bring to a gentle boil,
cover, and remove from heat.  Let steep for 5 minutes.  Strain mixture,
reserving milk and discarding lavender. 

Combine egg yolks and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer.  Beat on
medium-high speed until very thick and pale yellow, 3 to 5 minutes. 
Meanwhile, return milk to a medium saucepan, and bring to a simmer over
medium heat. 

Add half of the milk to egg-yolk mixture, and whisk until blended.  Stir
mixture into remaining milk, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden
spoon. 

Remove from heat and immediately stir in cream.  Strain mixture into a
medium mixing bowl set in an ice water bath and let stand, stirring
frequently, until chilled.  Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to
manufacturer's instructions. 

Makes about 1 quart. 

VARIATIONS:  Choose the herbs you'd like to work with, keeping these two
things in mind:  First, the amount of herb or spice you use will depend on
its flavor and intensity.  (Cinnamon has a strong flavor, so you'd use
less than sage, for example, which is milder.)  And second, the longer the
herb or spice steeps in the milk, the stronger the flavor of the ice cream
will be.  For cinnamon ice cream, substitute 6 sticks of cinnamon for the
lavender, and let milk steep overnight.  When reheating the milk, sift in
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon.

                       Mango Ice Cream - Aam Kulfi

Recipe By     :Julie Sahni
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  Whole milk
  1 1/4           cups  Heavy cream
     1/4      teaspoon  Grated nutmeg
  5        tablespoons  Sugar
  1                cup  Fresh or canned mango puree, preferably
                        Indian Alfonzo mango

   Combine the milk and cream in a medium heavy-bottomed pan and bring to 
the boil.  Reduce the heat and cook the milk, gently bubbling, stirring 
often, until it reduces to half the amount, about 2 1/2 cups.  Set aside 
to cool.
   When cool, stir in the nutmeg, sugar, and the mango pulp.  Pour the 
mixture distributing it evenly, into 6 kulfi molds.  If kulfi mounds are 
unavailable use popover or muffin tins or small ramekins and cover with 
plastic wrap.  Freeze until set, about 6 hours.
   To serve, remove the kulfi by running a sharp knife around the inside 
surface of each mold.  If necessary dip the molds in hot water to loosen 
them.  Slip each kulfi on a dessert plate and cut crossways into 3 to 4 
slices and serve.
   This recipe yields 6 servings.

                    Mock Strawberry - Banana Ice Cream

Recipe By     :(Steve Silverman)
Serving Size  : 2     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                 Pt  Strawberries
  1                     Banana
  2               Tbsp  Sugar -- to taste
  8                 Oz  Nonfat Yogurt

  If you have strawberries to get rid of try this. 

          Get a Donvier Ice Cream Machine. This has a hollow
          cylindrical part you keep in the freezer.  You put a mix
          into it, stir for a few minutes and enjoy.  Along with
          dishwashers (and the Internet), one of the major arguments
          in favor of high technology.

          Clean a batch of strawberries (a pint), 
          OPTION: add a banana (without peel)
          sugar 2 T or to taste
          1 container (8 oz.) nonfat yogurt

          Blend all this and put into Donvier machine.

          Adjusting the sugar might involve some experiments but these
          are not too hard to bear.

  1                cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  fresh lemon juice

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        makes 2 quarts - double or triple for size
                        your ice cream freezer
  1                cup  sugar
  2               tbsp  flour
  1                cup  milk
  2               cups  mashed peaches*
  2               tbsp  lemon juice
     1/2          pint  whipping cream -- (half-pint carton)

Mix sugar, flour and milk and cook on medium heat until thick, stirring
occasionally (can do this in microwave at 50% power). Add peaches, lemon
juice and whipping cream. This makes 2 quarts.

Freezing instructions: Put mixture into ice cream freezer can,  and
assemble freezer. Pour ice (fine ice is better) until it is about 3-inches
deep. Sprinkle 1/2 cup rock salt around the can. Layer ice/salt until it
is just above the lid of the can. If too much salt is added the ice cream
will freeze too fast around the edges of the can. Crank until the mixture
becomes stiff. Open the lid, being careful not to get salt into the ice
cream, and remove the paddle. Put Glad Wrap on top of the can and put the
lid back on. Put a cork into the hole in the lid of the can. Pour out some
of the water from the hole in the side of the ice cream freezer. Take out
some of the ice and add more salt and put the ice back in, so the salt
gets throughout the ice (makes it freeze harder). Cover the ice cream
freezer with several layers of newspapers and a heavy blanket. Let set for
about 30-45 minutes before serving.

Put left-over ice cream into an air-tight container and freeze in freezer.
This ice cream freezes well and is still smooth after being frozen.

* I like Freestone peaches the best.

NOTES : Note: To protect grass from salt pouring out of ice cream freezer,
place the freezer in some sort of large pan (assuming that it is cranked
outdoors).

Mix sugar, flour and milk and cook on medium heat until thick, stirring occasionally (can do this in microwave at 50% power). Add peaches, lemon juice and whipping cream. This makes 2 quarts.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Freezing instructions: Put mixture into ice cream freezer can,  and assemble freezer. Pour ice (fine ice is better) until it is about 3-inches deep. Sprinkle 1/2 cup rock salt around the can. Layer ice/salt until it is just above the lid of the can. If too much salt is added the ice cream will freeze too fast around the edges of the can. Crank until the mixture becomes stiff. Open the lid, being careful not to get salt into the ice cream, and remove the paddle. Put Glad Wrap on top of the can and put the lid back on. Put a cork into the hole in the lid of the can. Pour out some of the water from the hole in the side of the ice cream freezer. Take out some of the ice and add more salt and put the ice back in, so the salt gets throughout the ice (makes it freeze harder). Cover the ice cream freezer with several layers of newspapers and a heavy blanket. Let set for about 30-45 minutes before serving.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;Put left-over ice cream into an air-tight container and freeze in freezer.

Recipe By     :Sara Moulton
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  Peaches -- peeled, pitted,
                        and sliced
  1                cup  Sugar
  2        tablespoons  Fresh lemon juice
     1/4           cup  Water -- plus
     1/2           cup  Boiling water
  1                cup  Crumbled amaretti, (Italian almond
                        macaroon cookies)
  3        tablespoons  Amaretto
  6                     Egg yolks
  2          teaspoons  Vanilla
  2               cups  Heavy cream -- well chilled

   In a bowl toss the peaches with 1/4 cup of the sugar and the lemon
juice and let the mixture stand for 30 minutes.  Drain the peaches and
puree them in the food processor.  In a heavy saucepan combine the
remaining 3/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water, bring the mixture to a boil
over moderate heat, washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides
of the pan with the brush dipped in cold water, and simmer the syrup until
it is pale golden caramel.  Add the 1/2 cup boiling water carefully (the
mixture will bubble up) and simmer the syrup, stirring, until the caramel
is dissolved.
   In a small bowl sprinkle the cookies with the Amaretto and let stand
for 5 minutes.  In the large mixer bowl beat the egg yolks until they are
thick and pale, add the syrup in a stream, beating, and beat the mixture
until cool.  Stir in the vanilla, peach puree, cookie mixture and cream.
   Freeze mixture in the ice cream freezer according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
   This recipe yields 2 quarts.

              Prune Sherry Ice Cream With Burnt Sugar Sauce

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6             ounces  pitted prunes -- (about 1 cup)
     1/4           cup  dry Sherry
  1 2/3           cups  sugar
  1         tablespoon  cornstarch
  1              whole  large egg
  3              large  egg yolks
  2               cups  milk
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  sliced almonds -- toasted lightly

In a saucepan combine the prunes and 1 cup water, bring the water to a
boil, and simmer the prunes for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they are very
soft.  Add the Sherry, simmer the mixture for 1 minute, and let it cool. 
In a food processor puree the mixture coarse.

In a bowl whisk together 2/3 cup of the sugar, the cornstarch, the whole
egg, and the yolks and add the milk, scalded, in a stream, whisking.  In a
heavy saucepan bring the mixture to a boil over moderate heat, whisking,
and boil it, whisking constantly, for 2 minutes.  Strain the custard
through a fine sieve into a metal bowl set in a large bowl of ice and cold
water and add the prune mixture and the cream.  Stir the custard mixture
until it is cold and freeze it in an ice-cream freezer according to the
manufacturer's instructions.  Line a metal loaf pan, 9 by 5 by 3 inches,
with plastic wrap, spoon the ice cream into it, and freeze the ice cream,
the top smoothed and the surface covered with plastic wrap, for at least 8
hours or overnight.  The ice cream may be made 1 week in advance.

In a dry large deep heavy skillet cook the remaining 1 cup sugar over
moderately low heat, undisturbed, until it is melted, increase the heat to
moderate, and cook the sugar, swirling the skillet occasionally, until it
turns a deep caramel.  Remove the skillet from the heat, pour 1 cup hot
water carefully into the side of the skillet, and boil the burnt sugar
sauce, stirring, until it is syrupy and reduced to about 3/4 cup.  The
sauce may be made 1 week in advance and kept covered and chilled.  Unmold
the ice cream and serve it, sliced, with the sauce, warm or at room
temperature, and sprinkled with the almonds.

Serves 6 to 8.

                 Roasted Pineapple Ice Cream With Hubert

Recipe By     :Hubert Sandot
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     pineapple -- peeled, cored,
                        and cut in 1/2" cubes
  1 1/3           cups  sugar
  5               cups  heavy cream
  4        tablespoons  dark rum
  8              large  egg yolks

Place pineapple on a tray lined with a Silpat (a French nonstick baking
mat).  Sprinkle with 1/3 cup sugar, and bake in a 200 degree oven,
checking every 30 minutes, until juices become syrupy, about 2 hours.  Set
aside. 

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring 4 cups cream to a gentle boil.  Turn
heat off before adding rum.  Add pineapple, reserving 1/2 cup, and remove
from heat.  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk
attachment, whisk yolks and remaining 1 cup sugar until pale and
thickened, about 2 minutes.  Place cream mixture over medium heat, and
bring just to a boil.  Whisking constantly, add about 1/2 cup cream
mixture to lightened yolks.  Add yolk mixture to saucepan, and continue to
whisk until thickened, about 3 minutes.  Set aside to cool. 

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat
the remaining 1 cup cream until soft peaks form.  Gently fold into cooled
yolk mixture.  Transfer to an ice-cream machine, and freeze according to
the manufacturer's instructions.  Serve with a spoonful of reserved
pineapple. 

This recipe yields 1 1/2 quarts. 

Comments:  Chef Hubert Sandot's cooking often reflects his multinational
heritage.  He was born in Madagascar, raised in Paris (his father is from
Martinique, his mother from France), and now lives and works in New
Orleans.  As chef and owner of Martinique Bistro, his menu is a fusion of
cultural influences: He uses Louisiana ingredients, French techniques, and
influences from Africa, Spain, Germany, and the Caribbean.  When selecting
pineapples, Hubert always gives a gentle pull to one of the leaves; if it
comes out easily, he knows the fruit is ripe.

3-inches deep. Sprinkle 1/2 cup rock salt around the can. Layer ice/salt
until it is just above the lid of the can. If too much salt is added the
ice cream will freeze too fast around the edges of the can. Crank until
the mixture becomes stiff. Open the lid, being careful not to get salt
into the ice cream, and remove the paddle. Put Glad Wrap on top of the can
and put the lid back on. Put a cork into the hole in the lid of the can.
Pour out some of the water from the hole in the side of the ice cream
freezer. Take out some of the ice and add more salt and put the ice back
in, so the salt gets throughout the ice (makes it freeze harder). Cover
the ice cream freezer with several layers of newspapers and a heavy
blanket. Let set for about 30-45 minutes before serving.

Put left-over ice cream into an air-tight container and freeze in freezer.
This ice cream freezes well and is still smooth after being frozen.

NOTES : I like to use Mexican vanilla, and cut the amount used to 2 tsp.
for 4 quarts, and 1 Tablespoon for 6 quarts.

                            Sour Cherry Sorbet

Recipe By     :LABLaughRecipes
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : From Minnie(alt.cookies.)       Sorbet


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  450            grams  sour cherries
  115            grams  sugar (or to taste is using sweet sour
                        cherries)
  285      milliliters  water
  1         tablespoon  Kirsch (or other alcohol such as Calvados
                        or Cointreau -- (1 to 2)

Wash and stalk the cherries, then stone them over a non-corrosive saucepan
so that you can catch their juice as you cut them in half and extract the
stones. You can use a cherry stoner if you happen to have one. Discard the
stones.
Add the sugar and water. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 30
minutes or until the cherries are soft and cooked. Remove from the heat
and
leave to cool.
Puree then mix in the Kirsch or chosen alcohol.
Chill and set up your ice cream maker.
Churn until frozen then transfer to a container and store in the freezer.
If you do not have an ice cream maker, tip the pureed cherries into a
shallow container with a lid.
Place in the freezer and check after an hour. As soon as the edges begin
to
freeze, mash the ice crystals back into the mixture using a fork. Keep
repeating this process, until you have a smooth-textured sorbet.
You will have to check the mixture every 40 and then 30 minutes as the
sorbet becomes increasingly frozen.

Corn for dessert? Why not? This ice cream gets its kick from bourbona well-known derivative of corn.

                    The World's Best Vanilla Ice Cream

Recipe By     :Martha Stewart
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  whole milk
  1                     vanilla bean
  5              large  egg yolks
     3/4           cup  sugar
  1                cup  heavy cream
  1           teaspoon  vanilla extract

Split vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape.  In a medium saucepan, heat
milk, vanilla bean, and scrapings.  Bring to a gentle boil, cover, and
remove from heat.  Steep for 30 minutes.  Combine egg yolks and sugar in
the bowl of an electric mixer.  Beat at medium-high speed until very thick
and pale yellow, 3 to 5 minutes. 

Meanwhile, return milk to a simmer.  Remove vanilla bean.  Add half the
milk to egg-yolk mixture and whisk until blended.  Stir into remaining
milk and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick
enough to coat a spoon.  Remove from heat and immediately stir in cream. 

Pass mixture through a strainer into a medium bowl, set over an ice bath
so it begins to chill.  Stir in vanilla extract, then freeze in an
ice-cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. 

Makes about 1 quart.

                         Three Sisters Ice Cream

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        for 6-quart ice cream freezer:
                        (refreshing "tootie-fruity" flavor)
  6                     eggs
  3               cups  sugar
  4                     bananas -- , mashed
  1          large can  pineapple -- , crushed
  1          small can  frozen orange juice concentrate
  2               cans  milnot -- (2-3 cans)
  1                tsp  vanilla
                        milk -- --
                        -- to fill freezer can 2/3 full
  1               dash  salt

Beat eggs. Mix all ingredients except milk and put into freezer can. Add
milk to fill freezer 2/3 full.

Freezing instructions: Assemble freezer. Pour ice (fine ice is better)
until it is about 3-inches deep. Sprinkle 1/2 cup rock salt around the
can. Layer ice/salt until it is just above the lid of the can. If too much
salt is added the ice cream will freeze too fast around the edges of the
can. Crank until the mixture becomes stiff. Open the lid, being careful
not to get salt into the ice cream, and remove the paddle.  Put Glad Wrap
on top of the can and put the lid back on. Put a cork into the hole in the
lid of the can. Pour out some of the water from the hole in the side of
the ice cream freezer. Take out some of the ice and add more salt and put
the ice back in, so the salt gets throughout the ice (makes it freeze
harder). Cover the ice cream freezer with several layers of newspapers and
a heavy blanket. Let set for about 30-45 minutes before serving.

Put left-over ice cream into an air-tight container and freeze in freezer.
This ice cream freezes well and is still smooth after being frozen.

NOTES : NOTE: Do not drain pineapple or mix up frozen orange juice - just
dump them "as is" into the mixture.

  container w/ lid, electric mixer with paddle, rubber
  spatula, instant-read test thermometer, 2 stainless
  steel bowls (1 large), ice cream freezer
  
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast the pecan
  halves on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 10
  to 12 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Combine 1 1/4
  cups of sugar and the lemon juice in a 2 1/2-qt
  saucepan. Stir with a whisk to combine (the sugar will
  resemble moist sand). Caramelize the sugar for 8 to 10
  minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly
  with a whisk to break up any lumps (the sugar will
  first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as
  it caramelizes). Remove the saucepan from the heat.
  Add the unsweetened chocolate and stir gently to
  blend. Pour the chocolate-caramel mixture over the
  pecans and stir with a spoon to completely coat the
  pecans with the chocolate caramel; spread the mixture
  evenly over the bottom of the baking sheet. Freeze the
  chocolate pecan crunch for 20 minutes. Remove from the
  freezer. Chop the chocolate pecan crunch into 1/4"
  pieces. Store in a sealed plastic container in the
  freezer until needed.

Categories    : Ice Cream

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  Milk
  2                     Three-inch vanilla beans -- split
  10                    Egg yolks
  1 1/4           cups  Sugar
  2               cups  Heavy cream -- whipped to soft peak
                        Burnt Almond Caramel Sauce -- see * Note

  * Note:  See the "Burnt Almond Caramel Sauce" recipe which is included
in this collection.

   Heat the milk and vanilla beans together in a saucepan over moderate
heat until just beginning to simmer.
   In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks with sugar until light and thick. 
Slowly whisk hot milk into egg mixture.  Return to saucepan and heat
gently over moderate heat until it just begins to thicken (180 degrees).
   Remove custard at once from heat and strain into a bowl.  With the
point of a knife, scrape seeds from vanilla beans and add to custard. 
Cool and pour into ice cream freezer.  Freeze according to manufacturer's
directions.  When ice cream is partially set, add the whipped cream and
continue freezing until ice cream is firm.
   Allow ice cream to soften slightly before serving.  Scoop out into
chilled bowls and pour warm Burnt Almond Caramel Sauce over.
   This recipe yields 2 quarts of ice cream.
