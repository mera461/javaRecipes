FRENCH  APPLE  PIE


   I ate this apple pie at The Pink Adobe in Sante Fe, New Mexico and thought it was the best I'd ever eaten so I asked for the recipe. 1/2 tsp. cinnamon 1/2 tsp. nutmeg 2 tbsp. lemon juice 1/2 c. white sugar 1/4 c. seedless raisins 1 c. brown sugar 1/4 stick butter 2 tbsp. flour 1/2 c. shelled pecans (chopped) 1/4 c. milk   Put the apples in the pastry lined pan and sprinkle with the lemon juice, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Spread evenly with the white sugar and raisins.  Mix brown sugar, flour and butter in a bowl.  When well blended, spread over contents of the pie tin and sprinkle with pecans.  Add most of the milk, cover with the pastry top, pricking with a fork.  Brush the rest of the milk on pastry.  Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Top with hard sauce.HARD SAUCE:
1/2 c. butter
