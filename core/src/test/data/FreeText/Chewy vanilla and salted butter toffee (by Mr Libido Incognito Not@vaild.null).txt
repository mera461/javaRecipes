Chewy vanilla and salted butter toffee

550 ml (2 1/4 cups) icing sugar
125 ml (1/2 cup) milk
50 ml (1/4 cup) corn syrup
1 vanilla bean, split
175 ml (3/4 cup) salted butter

Butter a loaf pan.

In saucepan, combine icing sugar, milk, corn syrup and vanilla bean. Bring 
to a boil over high heat, stirring with a wooden spoon. Reduce heat and 
simmer for 5 minutes. Remove vanilla bean.

Gradually stir in butter. Cook, stirring frequently, until temperature 
reaches 110? C (225? F) on a candy thermometer.

Pour into loaf pan and let cool at room temperature for at least 2 hours 
before cutting into 18 pieces.

Wrap caramels with plastic wrap or parchment paper. (Do not use waxed 
paper as it will stick to the caramels.)

For different flavours, add 5 ml (1 tsp) of lemon zest, 4 to 5 star anise, 
2 cinnamon sticks, 4 to 5 cloves or 2 to 3 cardamom pods, etc., with or 
without the vanilla bean. For easy removal of flavourings, place in 2 or 3 
layers of cheesecloth and tie with string.

Makes 18 caramels.
