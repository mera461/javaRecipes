"BEST - EVER  QUICHE  LORRAINE"


   *The secret is the mustard.   Dijon is great - or you can use spicy brown. 1/3 lb. deli-sliced ham, cut into pieces 2 c. grated Jarlsburg Swiss cheese 3 eggs, do not substitute 1 1/2 c. light cream Dash of nutmeg Dash of pepper Prepared mustard   Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Place prepared pie shell in a quiche dish.  Spread the bottom of the pastry shell with mustard (a heaping teaspoonful).  Prick the pastry with a fork in several areas then bake for 10 minutes.  Cool slightly.  *Reduce heat to 350 degrees. Sprinkle half of the cheese on the bottom of pie shell, then ham, and then rest of cheese.  In a medium bowl, beat eggs and light cream, nutmeg and pepper until well mixed but not frothy.  Pour into pie shell.  *Sprinkle top with nutmeg (do not omit).  Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until top is golden and center is firm when gently shaken. Let cool on wire rack for 10 minutes.  *This is absolutely delicious!
