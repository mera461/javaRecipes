Luau Ribs

Serves 5
Recipe By: Lynnda Cloutier

2 jar peach baby food (4 1/2 oz. each -- or you may use regular 
canned peaches or canned tropical fruit and puree in blender)
1/3 cup catsup
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/3 cup vinegar
2 clove garlic -- minced
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons ginger
dash pepper
4 pounds meaty spareribs

For sauce, mix all ingredients except ribs. Rub ribs on both sides 
with salt and pepper. Place ribs, meat side up in a shallow foil 
lined pan. Bake for 15 minutes at 450. Spoon off fat. Pour sauce over 
ribs. Continue baking in a moderate 350 oven for 1 1/2 hours or until 
done. The oven may be turned down to 300 and the ribs cooked longer, 
about 2 hours.

Serves 5 to 6
