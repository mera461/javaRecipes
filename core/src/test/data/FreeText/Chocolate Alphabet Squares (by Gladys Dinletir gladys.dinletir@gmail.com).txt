Chocolate Alphabet Squares	Good Housekeeping, December 1993

(recipe 16)

1 cup margarine or butter (2 sticks)
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa Ornamental Frosting (below) assorted food
colorings and colored sugar

ABOUT 3 1/2 HOURS BEFORE SERVING OR DAY AHEAD:
1=2E In large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat margarine or butter,
sugar, vanilla extract, and salt until blended. Increase speed to high;
beat until mixture is light and fluffy.
2=2E With wooden spoon, gradually stir in flour and cocoa to make a soft
dough. Shape dough into 2 balls; wrap each with plastic wrap and
refrigerate 1 hour or until firm. (Or, place dough in freezer 30
minutes.)
3=2E Preheat oven to 350=B0F. On lightly floured surface, with floured
rolling pin, roll one ball of dough into a 10" by 6" rectangle. Cut
rectangle length-wise into 3 strips; then cut crosswise into 5 strips
to make 2" by 2" squares. With pancake turner, carefully place cookies
on ungreased large cookie sheet, about 1 inch apart.
4=2E Bake cookies 10 minutes. Cool cookies on cookie sheet 5 minutes;
then place on wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining
dough.
5=2E Prepare Ornamental Frosting. Divide half of this white frosting
among several small bowls, depending on how many different colors you
want to use; stir in enough food coloring to lint these frostings for
painting the alphabet letters on cookies. If necessary, add a little
water so frostings will spread easily.
Keep bowls covered with plastic wrap to prevent frostings from drying
out.
6=2E With small or medium artist's paintbrushes, paint each cookie with
untinted frosting, leaving a small border around cookie; let dry
completely, about 30 minutes. With small artist's brush, paint
different letters of the alphabet on each cookie; sprinkle letters with
colored sugar. Set cookies aside to allow frosting to dry completely,
at least 1 hour. If not serving cookies right away, store in tightly
covered containers. Makes 30 cookies.

ORNAMENTAL FROSTING: In small bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat one
16-ounce package confectioners' sugar, 1/3 cup warm water, and 3
tablespoons meringue powder* until mixture is stiff and knife drawn
through mixture leaves a clean-cut path.

* Meringue powder is available in specially stores or wherever
cake-decorating equipment is sold. Or, write for catalog to Wilton
Industries. Inc., 2240 W. 75th St., Woodridge, IL60517.
