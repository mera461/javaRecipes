Request: Heavenly Hash
i just love this but have no idea how to get it I have been all over the
sites

Heavenly Hash

1/2 package (12oz) chocolate "almond bark" 
3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips 
1 tablespoon peanut butter 
1 1/2 cup mini-marshmallows 
2 cups Golden Grahams cereal 
1 cup Spanish peanuts 

Combine almond bark and chocolate chips and melt over low heat; stir in
peanut butter. Combine marshmallows, cereal, and peanuts in a large mixing
bowl; pour melted chocolate mixture over all and mix to blend well. Spread
on wax paper and let harden (to set it quickly, put it in freezer for a
few minutes). Break up with hands or a knife and store in the refrigerator
in a tightly covered tin.
