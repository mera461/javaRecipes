Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup

1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut up
Black pepper to taste
1 Tbsp olive oil
4 (32 oz) boxes low-sodium chicken broth
1 package egg noodles
1 can sliced carrots, drained, or 2 cups sliced fresh carrots
1 Tbsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
Crackers (optional)

Stir-fry chicken breast in olive oil with black pepper; remove with a
slotted spoon and set aside. Meanwhile, combine the noodles, chicken
broth and celery in a stewpot; also add the carrots if using fresh
carrots. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to low and allow
to simmer. Add chicken, carrots, garlic powder and onion powder and
simmer 20 minutes. Ladle into soup bowls; if desired, sprinkle each
with Parmesan cheese and/or serve with crackers.
