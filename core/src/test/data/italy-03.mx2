                  A Drum Of Eggplant And Bucatini  - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggplants - (each at least 11" long)
                        Salt -- as needed
     1/2           cup  toasted bread crumbs
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped onions
  1                     celery rib -- finely chopped
  1              large  carrot -- finely chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  5               cups  chopped fresh plum tomatoes - (abt 10 med)
                        = (or drained canned plum tomatoes)
     1/4           cup  dry red wine
  1                     bay leaf
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2               cups  bucatini broken into thirds
  1              pound  ground veal
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  dry white wine
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Pecorino cheese
     1/2           cup  toasted bread crumbs
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2        tablespoons  butter
  1 1/2           cups  cubed fresh mozzarella cheese
                        = (fior di latte)
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves
     1/2           cup  peanut oil -- for frying
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino cheese

Cut off the stems of the eggplants and discard.  Slice the eggplant lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Salt and layer the eggplant slices in a colander set over a bowl.  Place a large bowl of water on top of the slices to act as a weight.  Let the eggplant "sweat" for at least 1 hour to remove the excess water.

Butter a 9- by 3 1/2-inch-deep round mold or cake pan and coat the inside evenly with the 1/2 cup bread crumbs.  Shake out the excess crumbs and refrigerate the mold until ready to fill.

To make the sauce:  In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil and cook, stirring, the onions, carrot, and celery until they soften.  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic softens.  Stir in the tomatoes, red wine, and bay leaf.  Cover the pan and simmer the sauce for 30 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper and set aside.  Remove the bay leaf before using.

Cook the bucatini according to the directions.  Drain and transfer to a large bowl.  Set aside.

In a medium-size bowl, combine the veal, egg, white wine, the 2 tablespoons grated Pecorino, bread crumbs, and salt.  Mix gently to just combine the ingredients.  Form marble-sized meatballs with your hands.

Heat the butter in a large saute pan and fry the meatballs until browned on all sides.  Transfer the meatballs to the bowl with the bucatini.  Add the mozzarella, parsley, and 2 cups of the tomato sauce.  Stir to combine the ingredients well and set aside.

Rinse and dry the eggplant slices.  Heat the peanut oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat.  Fry the eggplant slices a few at a time until they soften, about 2 minutes on each side.  Drain the slices on brown paper.  Use additional oil if the pan seems dry.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

Line the prepared mold with the eggplant slices, draping them lengthwise over the bottom and overlapping them up the sides of the mold.  There should be about a 3-inch overhang over the top edges of the mold.  Make sure there are no open spots and that the mold is completely lined with the slices.

Spoon the bucatini mixture evenly in the mold, packing it down with a wooden spoon all the way around.  Fold the overhanging slices of eggplant in over the top of the mold; the mixture should be completely encased by the eggplant.

Spread 1/2 cup of the remaining tomato sauce over the top of the mold and sprinkle with the 1/4 cup Pecorino.  Bake the timballo, uncovered, for 45 minutes.  It is done when the timballo shrinks a bit along the sides and a knife will easily move along the sides.  Remove the mold from the oven and loosely cover the top with a sheet of aluminum foil.  Let the mold stand for 20 minutes.

Heat the remaining tomato sauce.  Remove the foil from the timballo and run a butter knife around the inside edges to loosen it.  Place a serving dish larger than the mold over the top and carefully invert it onto the dish.  Cut the timballo into wedges and serve with additional sauce on the side.

Tip:  Use fresh mozzarella cheese, but if it is not available, substitute pasteurized.

Note:  Instead of frying the meatballs, bake them on a lightly greased cookie sheet at 350 degrees until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.

Note:  For a nice presentation, spread additional sauce over the top of the unmolded timballo and garnish with curls of Pecorino cheese.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Making a timballo, or timpano, is an event.  It becomes the moment in which ordinary ingredients like macaroni, cheese, and vegetables are transformed into an extraordinary, impressive drum of baked pasta that, when unmolded, receives a standing ovation.  The region of Campania claims the timballo as its own and the recipe that follows comes from Sorrento.  It calls for bucatini, a thicker cut of hollow spaghetti, which neatly nestles and holds the ingredients together.  It is customary in Campania to use buffalo milk mozzarella, a cheese with a delicate texture and superb taste, but it is very perishable and not readily available.  Fresh cow's milk mozzarella can be used instead.

Assembling the timballo is easy when done in stages.  Make the sauce several days ahead; cube the cheese and cook the marble-size meatballs 2 days ahead.  Patience is the key to the unmolding; you will get much neater wedges by allowing the timballo to cool for about 20 minutes -- and the joy of tasting that first forkful will be worthy of the best drumroll.

                  Anthony Stella's Potato Gnocchi - ...

Recipe By     :Anthony Stella
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             pounds  Idaho baking potatoes - (abt 5)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  9                     turns of the pepper mill
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino-Romano cheese -- plus
                        additional for sprinkling on top -- if desired
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  2        tablespoons  melted unsalted butter
  4               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
  2               cups  Anthony Stella's Tomato Sauce -- (see recipe)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Peel the potatoes and wrap them in aluminum foil.  Bake the potatoes for 1 1/2 hours.  Transfer the potatoes to a food mill fitted with a large disk and set over a large bowl.  Pass the potatoes through the food mill.  Or use a potato masher to hand-mash the potatoes.  Do not use a food processor as this will break down the potato starch and make the potatoes too gluelike.

Spread the potatoes out on a baking sheet.  Cover them with a towel and chill them for several hours in the refrigerator.

Spread the potatoes out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Sprinkle the potatoes with the salt, pepper, and grated cheese.  Drizzle the potatoes with the egg and butter.  Work the ingredients into the potatoes with your hands.  Begin adding the flour, a cupful at a time, kneading it into the potatoes with your hands.  Continue adding and kneading in enough flour to form a soft but not sticky dough.  Adding too much flour will result in heavy-tasting gnocchi.

Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and work with one piece at a time, keeping the rest covered.  Roll each piece out into an 18- by 2-inch-thick rope.  With a knife cut the rope into 1/2-inch pieces and transfer them to towel lined baking sheets.

To serve 4 to 6, bring 4 to 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a pasta pot.  Add 3 dozen gnocchi and boil them.  When the gnocchi bob to the surface, scoop them out with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a platter.

Toss the gnocchi with 2 cups of Anthony Stella's Tomato Sauce and sprinkle the gnocchi with additional grated Pecorino Romano cheese, if desired.

Serve immediately.

Note:  Since this makes about 13 dozen gnocchi, freeze what you are not going to use.  To do this, and to prevent the gnocchi from sticking together when frozen, arrange them in single layers on a baking sheet.  Cover the sheet loosely with aluminum foil and freeze.  When the gnocchi are hard, transfer them to heavy-duty plastic bags.  They freeze well for up to 6 months.  Add them frozen to boiling water when ready to cook.

This recipe yields 13 dozen.

Comments:  Chef Anthony Stella says that the secret to making light-tasting potato gnocchi is to refrigerate the dough for several hours before forming them.  We made these together for a Ciao Italia segment and when the cameras went down, the crew and I were treated to these with Anthony's Tomato Sauce.  We knew they were good when only silence reigned at the dining room table.  Try them and see for yourself.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Peel the potatoes and wrap them in aluminum foil.  Bake the potatoes for 1 1/2 hours.  Transfer the potatoes to a food mill fitted with a large disk and set over a large bowl.  Pass the potatoes through the food mill.  Or use a potato masher to hand-mash the potatoes.  Do not use a food processor as this will break down the potato starch and make the potatoes too gluelike.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the potatoes out on a baking sheet.  Cover them with a towel and chill them for several hours in the refrigerator.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread the potatoes out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Sprinkle the potatoes with the salt, pepper, and grated cheese.  Drizzle the potatoes with the egg and butter.  Work the ingredients into the potatoes with your hands.  Begin adding the flour, a cupful at a time, kneading it into the potatoes with your hands.  Continue adding and kneading in enough flour to form a soft but not sticky dough.  Adding too much flour will result in heavy-tasting gnocchi.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and work with one piece at a time, keeping the rest covered.  Roll each piece out into an 18- by 2-inch-thick rope.  With a knife cut the rope into 1/2-inch pieces and transfer them to towel lined baking sheets.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To serve 4 to 6, bring 4 to 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a pasta pot.  Add 3 dozen gnocchi and boil them.  When the gnocchi bob to the surface, scoop them out with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a platter.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Toss the gnocchi with 2 cups of Anthony Stella&apos;s Tomato Sauce and sprinkle the gnocchi with additional grated Pecorino Romano cheese, if desired.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Since this makes about 13 dozen gnocchi, freeze what you are not going to use.  To do this, and to prevent the gnocchi from sticking together when frozen, arrange them in single layers on a baking sheet.  Cover the sheet loosely with aluminum foil and freeze.  When the gnocchi are hard, transfer them to heavy-duty plastic bags.  They freeze well for up to 6 months.  Add them frozen to boiling water when ready to cook.
</DirT>

This recipe yields 13 dozen.

                   Anthony Stella's Tomato Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Anthony Stella
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  onion - (8 oz) -- peeled, and
                        cut in half through the root end
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2               cans  Hunt's whole tomatoes - (28 oz ea)
  2          teaspoons  brown sugar
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt

Wrap the onion in cheesecloth and set aside.

Pass the tomatoes through a food mill over a bowl.  Discard the seeds.

Heat the olive oil in a saucepan and pour in the tomatoes.  Stir to blend the ingredients.  Place the onion in the center of the pot.  Bring the mixture to a boil, and allow it to simmer, uncovered, for 1 1/2 hours.  Several times during the cooking, scrape down the sides of the pot.  Stir in the sugar and salt.  When it darkens in color and has reduced in volume to become thick, the sauce is ready to use, or to freeze for future use.

This recipe yields about 6 cups sauce.

Comments:  Chef Anthony Stella surprised me with his method for making tomato sauce.  Forget about the traditional fresh garlic and fragrant basil as co-ingredients with juicy plum tomatoes.  Instead, onions wrapped in cheesecloth and Hunt's canned whole tomatoes are his choice because he believes that these tomatoes are sweeter and more consistent in flavor than the imported San Marzano types.  I was skeptical, but Chef Anthony made a believer out of me when he demonstrated this recipe on our series and confirmed that there is indeed more than one way to make a good tomato sauce.  It is important that the sauce cook uncovered, and that the sides of the pot be scraped down frequently; these techniques are the secret flavor enhancers.  This is an all-purpose tomato sauce.  Chef Anthony especially loves it on his homemade potato gnocchi.

        Badly Cut Yellow Beet Pasta With Roasted Vegetables - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTA ===
  1              small  yellow or red beet
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  finely-ground durum semolina flour
  2          teaspoons  salt
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2          teaspoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  5             medium  carrots - (12 oz total) -- cut 1/4"-thk rounds
  2              large  shallots -- peeled
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grated zest of 1 large lemon
  5        tablespoons  butter
                        === TO COOK THE PASTA ===
  6             quarts  water
  1         tablespoon  salt
  6              dozen  maltagliati
                        Green tops from 6 medium-size beets -- stemmed, washed
                        well, and torn into pieces
                        === TO FINISH ===
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Remove the top from the beet, leaving 2 inches of stem attached.  Reserve the top.  Cut the beet in half lengthwise and wrap the halves in aluminum foil.  Bake until a knife easily pierces the flesh, about 30 minutes.

Alternately, wrap the beet halves tightly in plastic wrap and microwave on high power for 5 minutes.  Or boil the beet for 20 to 25 minutes.  When cool, peel and discard the skin.  Puree the beet in a food processor or blender.  You will need 2 tablespoons of pureed beet.

If making the dough in a processor, add the eggs to the pureed beet and pulse to blend.  Mix 2 cups of the unbleached flour with the semolina flour and salt and add to the bowl of the processor.  Process until the mixture begins to form in a ball.  Add only enough of the remaining flour until the dough holds together as one piece and cleans the sides of the bowl.  Remove the dough from the processor and knead it on a lightly floured work surface for 2 to 3 minutes.  Let the dough rest under a bowl for 30 minutes to relax the gluten and make it easier to roll.

To make the dough by hand, mix together 2 cups of the unbleached flour, the semolina flour, and salt directly on the work surface.  Fashion a well in the center.  Crack the eggs in the center of the well and beat the eggs with a fork until foamy.  Add the pureed beet and mix well.  Take care not to break the wall of flour.  With your hands, bring the flour from the inside of the wall into the egg mixture.  Work in a clockwise fashion.  Form a ball of dough using the remaining flour as needed.  Push the excess flour aside and knead the dough until it is smooth and soft but not sticky, about 5 minutes.  Let the dough rest under a bowl for 30 minutes.

Cut the dough into four equal pieces.  Work with one piece at a time and keep the rest covered.  With a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a 9- by 6-inch rec­tangle.  Flour the piece lightly.  Using a pasta machine, flatten the dough to the last setting.  Trim the sheet of dough to 36 by 5 1/2 inches.  Keep the trimmings to re-roll later.

Cut the sheet in half crosswise into two 18-inch-long pieces.  Cut each half lengthwise down the middle to form two strips.  Cut nine 2- by 2 3/4-inch pieces from each strip, then cut the pieces diagonally to form tri­angles.  These are the maltagliati.

Cover several cookie sheets with clean kitchen tow­els and arrange the maltagliati on them in single lay­ers.  Repeat the process with the remaining pieces of dough, separating the layers of maltagliati with more kitchen towels.

To make the maltagliati ahead, allow them to dry thoroughly on the towels for at least 2 days.  This may take even longer if it is humid.  The maltagliati are suf­ficiently dried when the edges begin to curl and they feel brittle.  Store them in airtight containers for up to 2 months.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Brush a cookie sheet with the olive oil and arrange the sliced carrots in a single layer on the sheet.  Cut the shallots into halves and place them on the sheet.  Roast until a knife eas­ily pierces the vegetables, about 30 minutes.  Turn the vegetables once halfway through the cooking time.

Transfer the carrots to a bowl.  Cut the shallots into small pieces and add to the carrots.  Toss with the salt and lemon zest.

Heat the butter in a large saute pan while the pasta cooks.

Bring the water to a boil in a pasta pot, add the salt, 6 dozen of the maltagliati, and the torn beet tops.  Cook until the maltagliati are al dente, about 4 minutes.

Drain the pasta and beet tops, leaving a little water clinging to the pasta.  Transfer the mixture to the saute pan, add the carrots and shallots, and mix together quickly over medium-high heat until hot.  Transfer the maltagliati mixture to a platter, sprinkle with the cheese, and serve immediately.

Note:  To sauce all the maltagliati, quadruple the sauce ingredients.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Maltagliati means badly cut, referring to randomly cut to soups.  This conjures up visions of rustic charm but when I make them, I give them an element of elegance by adding pureed yellow beets to the dough, resulting in sunny, golden-hued pasta.  The more common red beet can be substituted if yellow ones are not available.  The sauce, a combina­tion of roasted carrots and shallots, adds texture and a slight sweet taste, while the beet tops, cooked along with the maltagliati, balance the sweetness with their sharpness and lend a wonder­ful color contrast.  Save time by making the maltagliati ahead and drying them.

                    Bread Gnocchi - {Gnocchi Di Pane}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  2               cups  finely-crumbled crustless bread
  1 1/4           cups  milk
  1              large  egg
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 2)
                        === SAUCE ===
  8        tablespoons  unsalted butter - (1 stick)
  1              large  garlic clove -- thinly sliced
     1/2           cup  finely-minced flat-leaf parsley

Place the bread in a bowl, add the milk, egg, cheese and salt, and mix well.  Add just enough flour to make a thick dough, (too much flour will make the dumplings too heavy), and knead it until it is the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 1/2 hours.

Bring 3 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.  Butter a large ovenproof casserole dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter.

In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 7 tablespoons butter.  Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute, pressing on it with a wooden spoon to flavor the butter.  Discard the garlic, add the parsley and cook until the butter browns slightly.  Keep the sauce warm over very low heat.

Using 2 teaspoons dipped in ice water, drop small spoonfuls of the dough into the boiling water, about 2 dozen at a time.  Once the gnocchi bob to the top, cook until just tender, about 5 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon, draining well, and place in the casserole dish.  Keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining gnocchi.

Pour the butter sauce over the gnocchi, toss gently with a spoon to coat them evenly, and serve immediately.

This recipe makes about 5 dozen, yields 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Say gnocchi to an Italian cook and invariably you will get many explanations as to what they are.  Many consider gnocchi to be little dumplings made with potato and flour, but there are many variations of gnocchi from semolina to ricotta.  This recipe is for bread gnocchi make with day old bread, eggs, flour and cheese.  They are delicious served with a sauce of butter, garlic, and parsley.

                 Butterfly Pasta And Fava Bean Mold - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1 3/4         pounds  cherry tomatoes
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/2           cup  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        === FOR THE TIMBALLO ===
                        Olive oil spray
  2              large  bay leaves
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- diced
  4             quarts  water - (to 6)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  shelled fresh fava or lima beans
  1              pound  farfalle
     1/2         pound  Fontina cheese -- rind removed,
                        and diced
     1/4         pound  fresh mozzarella cheese ball -- diced
                        = (fior di latte)
  3        tablespoons  half-and-half
                        Grinding of white pepper

Puree the cherry tomatoes in a food processor until smooth.  Transfer the mixture to a fine mesh strainer over a bowl.  Use a wooden spoon to press the tomato juice into the bowl; discard the seeds and skins.  Alternately, use a food mill.  There should be about 2 3/4 cups of tomato juice.

In a medium-size saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Pour in the tomato juice and cook, stirring, for a few minutes.  Stir in the heavy cream, cheese, and salt and continue to stir until the ingredients are well blended.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce, uncovered, until it is reduced by one third and thickens.  Keep the sauce covered and warm while the timballo bakes.  (Makes 2 cups)

Generously spray a 2 1/2-quart ovenproof glass bowl or other similar mold with olive oil spray.  Position the bay leaves in the base of the bowl and set aside.

Cook the pancetta in a medium-size non-stick pan over medium heat until the pancetta begins to crisp and give off its fat.

Meanwhile, fill a pasta pot with an insert with the water and bring to a boil.  Add the salt and fava or lima beans.  Cook the beans until tender but not mushy.  With a slotted spoon, remove the beans to a bowl, then add them to the pan with the pancetta.  (Don't discard the water.)  Cook the mixture over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Add the farfalle to the boiling water, stir to prevent them from sticking, cover the pot, and bring the water back to a rolling boil.  Uncover and cook the farfalle until al dente.  Lift the insert and drain the pot, then return the farfalle to the pot.  Over very low heat, stir in the pancetta mixture, the cheeses, half-and-half, and white pepper.  When all the cheese has melted, transfer the mixture to the glass bowl, pressing down with a wooden spoon to compact it.

Cover the bowl tightly with a sheet of aluminum foil.  Bake the timballo until browned on the bottom, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove the bowl from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

To unmold, remove the aluminum foil, place a serving dish over the top of the mold, and invert to unmold.  Serve the timballo cut into wedges with sauce on the side.

Note:  The sauce can be made 2 days ahead, refrigerated, and then reheated.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A timballo is a combination of ingredients, usually with some type of pasta, baked in a mold or springform pan and then unmolded.  Some timballi are chock-full of ingredients while others rely on just a few.  Nevertheless, they are impressive-looking and can even be made using ovenproof glass bowls.  Farfalle and fava beans flavored with Italian bacon and combined with Fontina and mozzarella cheese make a delicious timballo when served with a velvety cherry-tomato-and-cream sauce.  Fresh fava beans are usually available in the spring, but lima beans, either fresh or frozen, are a good alternative.

             Cannellini Beans With Fettuccine And Sage - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  dried cannellini beans
  3               cups  water for soaking beans -- then
                        fresh water for cooking them
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  red Spanish onion -- diced
     1/3         pound  chunk of pancetta -- diced
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh sage leaves
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  1              pound  fettuccine
     1/4           cup  reserved pasta cooking water
                        Grated Pecorino cheese -- for sprinkling

Soak the beans overnight in 3 cups of cold water.  Next day, drain the beans, which will have swelled in size, and place them in a 2-quart saucepan and cover them with fresh cold water.  Bring the water to a boil, lower the heat to medium-high, and cook the beans until a knife is easily inserted into them.  Do not overcook the beans or they will split and disintegrate in the water.  Drain and set aside.

In a saute pan, heat 1/3 cup of the olive oil.  Stir in the onions and pancetta and saute until the onions are soft and the pancetta is browned.  Stir in the sage and saute, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the beans and stir them gently to coat them with the oil and sage.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Turn off the heat and set aside while the fettuccine is cooking.

Cook the fettuccine in 4 to 6 quarts of rapidly boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Cook just until the fettuccine is al dente, meaning that the fettuccine is cooked through, retains its shape, and is still firm, not mushy.  Drain the fettuccine into a strainer and add it with the reserved cooking water directly to the saute pan.  Stir in the remaining olive oil and quickly reheat the mixture, stirring constantly until hot.  Transfer the mixture to a serving platter and serve at once.  Pass grated Pecorino cheese on the side.

Note:  Do not be alarmed at the amount of olive oil used in this recipe.  The beans absorb a lot of it so if you want to cut down on the amount of oil, remember that the dish will be drier in taste.

Did you know that Tuscans have Central America to thank for introducing cannellini beans into Italy?  Beans were imported to Italy in the sixteenth century.  Look for these beans under the name of white kidney or Great Northern beans.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Dried beans were historically considered "poor man's meat" and have been one of the main sources of protein in Italy and worldwide.  So it is not surprising to see so many dishes made with beans.  In Tuscany, and in particular in Florence, cooking beans is serious business.  Beans are to Florentine cooking what rice and polenta are to Venetian cooking.  Beans cooked in a flask, beans served at room temperature with onions and olive oil, beans pureed into soup, and beans spread over crusty bread and drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil are but a few of the ways to prepare them.  Cannellini beans are white and creamy in texture; they are used both fresh and dried.  For this recipe, use dried beans instead of the canned supermarket variety, which is very salty and just not as good a representation of the real taste.  If not available, substitute dried white kidney or Great Northern beans.  Soak the beans overnight to save time when making this dish.

Soak the beans overnight in 3 cups of cold water.  Next day, drain the beans, which will have swelled in size, and place them in a 2-quart saucepan and cover them with fresh cold water.  Bring the water to a boil, lower the heat to medium-high, and cook the beans until a knife is easily inserted into them.  Do not overcook the beans or they will split and disintegrate in the water.  Drain and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a saute pan, heat 1/3 cup of the olive oil.  Stir in the onions and pancetta and saute until the onions are soft and the pancetta is browned.  Stir in the sage and saute, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes.  Add the beans and stir them gently to coat them with the oil and sage.  Season with the salt and pepper.  Turn off the heat and set aside while the fettuccine is cooking.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the fettuccine in 4 to 6 quarts of rapidly boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Cook just until the fettuccine is al dente, meaning that the fettuccine is cooked through, retains its shape, and is still firm, not mushy.  Drain the fettuccine into a strainer and add it with the reserved cooking water directly to the saute pan.  Stir in the remaining olive oil and quickly reheat the mixture, stirring constantly until hot.  Transfer the mixture to a serving platter and serve at once.  Pass grated Pecorino cheese on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Do not be alarmed at the amount of olive oil used in this recipe.  The beans absorb a lot of it so if you want to cut down on the amount of oil, remember that the dish will be drier in taste.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Did you know that Tuscans have Central America to thank for introducing cannellini beans into Italy?  Beans were imported to Italy in the sixteenth century.  Look for these beans under the name of white kidney or Great Northern beans.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Dried beans were historically considered &quot;poor man&apos;s meat&quot; and have been one of the main sources of protein in Italy and worldwide.  So it is not surprising to see so many dishes made with beans.  In Tuscany, and in particular in Florence, cooking beans is serious business.  Beans are to Florentine cooking what rice and polenta are to Venetian cooking.  Beans cooked in a flask, beans served at room temperature with onions and olive oil, beans pureed into soup, and beans spread over crusty bread and drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil are but a few of the ways to prepare them.  Cannellini beans are white and creamy in texture; they are used both fresh and dried.  For this recipe, use dried beans instead of the canned supermarket variety, which is very salty and just not as good a representation of the real taste.  If not available, substitute dried white kidney or Great Northern beans.  Soak the beans overnight to save time when making this dish.

            Cannelloni With Mushrooms - {Cannelloni Al Funghi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
     1/2           cup  dried porcini mushrooms
  1                cup  cold water
  1            package  fresh button mushrooms - (12 oz)
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1                     garlic clove -- peeled and minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2               cups  ricotta cheese -- well drained
     1/4           cup  grated Asiago cheese*
     1/4      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  5             ounces  Emmentaler cheese -- thinly sliced
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- thinly sliced
                        === SAUCE ===
  7        tablespoons  butter
  4        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  2 1/2           cups  milk
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/4           cup  grated Asiago cheese*
                        === DOUGH ===
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil

* Note:  Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese can be substituted for the Asiago.

To make the filling, place the porcini in a bowl, cover with cold water, and soak for 30 minutes.  Drain and dice the porcini; reserve the liquid for another use.

Clean the button mushrooms with damp paper towels, then thinly slice them.

In a skillet, heat the olive oil, add the button mushrooms and garlic, and saute the mixture for about 4 minutes.  Add the porcini and continue to saute until the mushrooms are soft and the liquid has evaporated, about 5 to 7 minutes more.  Add salt and pepper, mix well, then transfer to a bowl.

In a bowl, mix the ricotta and 1/4 cup Asiago cheese and the nutmeg.  Add the mushroom mixture and blend well.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.

Cut the Emmentaler slices and prosciutto in half.  You should have 12 slices of each.  Cover and set aside.

To make the sauce, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan, over medium-high heat.  Add the flour and whisk the mixture for 1 minute or until a smooth paste is formed.  Lower the heat, and gradually add the milk, continually whisking until the sauce starts to thicken.  Remove the sauce from the heat, add the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the nutmeg, and stir to blend.  Keep the sauce covered and warm.  (If you make the sauce a day ahead, cover and refrigerate.  When ready to put the cannelloni together, reheat the sauce and thin it with a little milk.)

If making the dough by hand, mix 1 1/4 cups of the flour and the salt on a work surface.  Make a well in the center of the flour, add the eggs and olive oil, and mix with a fork or your fingers until a ball of dough is formed.  Use additional flour as needed.  Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.  Let rest, covered, for 10 minutes.

If using a food processor, pulse the flour and salt together, then add the eggs and oil through the feed tube.  Remove the dough and knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic.

On a floured surface, cut the dough into 2 pieces.  Use a pasta machine set to the thinnest setting or roll by hand into two 36- by 5-inch sheets.  Cut each sheet into six 6- by 5-inch rectangles and place them on a clean towel.

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water to the boil.  Add 6 rectangles at a time and boil 1 minute.  Scoop from the water and place rectangles in a baking pan full of ice water.  When cool enough to handle, dry the rectangles on clean towels.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly grease a 14- by 9-inch or larger baking pan with butter.  Set aside.

To fill the cannelloni, place a piece of Emmentaler cheese on each rectangle.  Top with a piece of prosciutto and about 3 tablespoons of the filling, carefully spreading it evenly.  Roll up the rectangles from the short side like a jelly roll.

Place the cannelloni in a single layer in the baking pan.  Reheat the sauce, thinning it with a little milk if necessary, and spread it over the top.  Dice the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and scatter it over the top.  Sprinkle on the remaining 1/4 cup Asiago cheese and grate the remaining nutmeg over the top.

Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until heated through, then run under the broiler for about 2 minutes to brown the top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Cannelloni are neat rolled cylinders of pasta filled with anything from vegetables and meat to cheese and seafood.  Baked under a blanket of sauce, they make a prized first or second course.  For this version, dried porcini and button mushrooms are combined with cheese and prosciutto and topped with a white sauce.  This whole dish takes about two hours to make, although you can make the filling and sauce a day ahead.  If so, the sauce will need to be thinned with additional milk, and warmed over low heat.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8              small  eggplants - (4" to 5" long) -- cut into 1" chunks
                        Coarse salt -- as needed
  1 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/4           cups  thinly-sliced celery
  1 1/2           cups  peanut oil -- more or less
     1/2           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  4             medium  onions -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  tomato paste
     2/3           cup  red wine vinegar
  1                cup  chopped pitted Sicilian olives in brine
     1/2           cup  capers in brine -- drained
     1/2           cup  sugar
  2          teaspoons  unsweetened cocoa powder
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the eggplant in a colander, sprinkle with coarse salt, and let sweat in the sink or on a plate for 1 hour.  Rinse and dry well.

In a small saucepan, bring the water to a boil.  Add the celery and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain the celery, reserving the water, and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat 3/4 cup peanut oil.  Add half the eggplant and fry, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove to brown paper to drain.  Repeat with the remaining eggplant, adding more peanut oil as necessary.  Drain off the oil

In the same frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  All the onions and saute until soft, about 10 minutes.  Lower the heat to medium, add the tomato paste, the reserved celery water, the vinegar, olives, capers, sugar, and cocoa and mix well.  Let simmer for about 5 minutes.  Add the eggplant and celery, stir well, let simmer for about 10 minutes.  Add the salt and pepper.

Spoon the caponata into clean jars, cap, and refrigerate or freeze.  (If freezing, be sure to allow room for expansion in the jars.)  Serve at room temperature.

             Caponata Tartlets - {Torte Piccole Di Caponata}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Nonna's Sponge Dough -- (see recipe)
  2               cups  caponata
                        = (homemade or store-bought)
  1                     egg -- slightly beaten

Lightly spray eight 3 1/2-inch fluted tartlet shells with olive oil spray and set aside.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a very lightly floured surface.  Knead it for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and no longer sticky.  Divide the dough into quarters.

Roll each quarter into a 12-inch round. Using a 4-inch plain biscuit cutter, cut 4 circles from each quarter. Line each tartlet shell with a dough circle, stretching it to allow the excess dough to hang over the edges of the shell.

Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the caponata in each tartlet pan, spreading it evenly to the edges.

Place one of the remaining dough circles on top of each tartlet and pinch the edges of the dough together to seal.  Cover the tartlets with a towel and let rise for 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

With scissors, cut an X in the center of each tartlet.  Brush the tops of the tartlets with the beaten egg.  Place the tartlets on two baking sheets and bake for 25 minutes, until the tops are golden brown.

Remove the tartlets to a cooling rack to cool for 10 minutes.  With the tip of a table knife, carefully lift each tartlet out of its shell and allow to cool on the rack.  Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.

This recipe yields 8 tartlets.

Comments:  These delicious little caponata tartlets, with their sweet-and-sour taste, make an elegant lunch with a salad.  Or tote them to a picnic or tailgate party, or make them miniature-size to serve as antipasti for a crowd.  Make the caponata for the filling or use a good prepared caponata.

         Country-Style Sardinian Gnocchi With Sausage Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     3/4         pound  fresh or store-bought Italian
                        sausage with fennel seeds -- casings removed and,
                        crumbled into pieces
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  crushed fennel seeds - (to 2) -- to your taste
  1 3/4         pounds  fresh tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        coarsely chopped
                        = (or one 28-oz can tomatoes)
     1/2           cup  diced drained dried tomatoes in olive oil -- (2 oz)
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1            package  powdered saffron -- dissolved in
  2        tablespoons  warm water
  1              large  bay leaf
  6                     fresh basil leaves -- cut into thin strips
     3/4         pound  plain or flavored malloreddus
     1/2           cup  grated Pecorino cheese

In a nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil, then add the sausage and cook slowly over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink but not browned.  With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl, leaving the fat behind.

Discard all but 1 teaspoon of the fat in the skillet.  Add the garlic and fennel seeds and cook, stirring, until the garlic begins to turn golden brown.  Stir in the fresh or canned tomatoes, dried tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, saffron, bay leaf, and basil leaves.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the sauce, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Uncover the skillet and cook 5 minutes more.  Return the sausage to the skillet, mixing it in well and cook 3 to 4 minutes longer.  Cover the sauce and keep it warm while the malloreddus are cooking.

Cook the malloreddus according to the directions until al dente.  Drain and transfer them to a large bowl.  Remove the bay leaf from the sauce before adding it to the malloreddus.  Pour 2 1/4 cups of the sauce (freeze the rest) over the malloreddus, mix well, then transfer the mixture to a serving platter.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top and serve immediately.

Note:  Crush fennel seeds in a spice mill or on a cutting board with a chef's knife.  To prevent the seeds from scattering off the board, spray the board with a little olive oil spray; the seeds will stay in place.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Malloreddus is the national pasta dish of Sardinia and the big cousin to fregola, another traditional pasta.  The term malloreddu comes from the Latin mallolus and means morsel or little bits of pasta dough that are hand-rolled on a round reed basket to make the characteristic shape and lines in the dough.  Another more recognizable word for this type of pasta is gnocchi, a little dumpling of flour and water.  Malloreddus is made from grano duro (hard wheat flour) and there are many variations.  They can be found in Italian specialty stores or ordered by mail.  Here they are combined with saffron and tomato and served with fresh or store-bought Italian sausage flavored with fennel seeds.  This recipe is from my Sardinian friends Mario and Giulia Cocco.

             Dried Prune Gnocchi - {Gnocchi Di Prugne Secche}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes
  1              large  egg
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
  1                cup  dried prunes -- cut in half
  1                cup  dried apricots -- cut in half
  1                cup  unsalted butter
     1/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon

Either boil the unpeeled potatoes whole in a large pot of water or bake them in the microwave according to your microwave's directions.  Let the potatoes cool, then peel them.

Rice the potatoes into a bowl or mash them by hand.  Blend in the egg and salt.

Heap the flour onto a work surface and make a hole in the center with your hands.  Put the potatoes in the center and begin working the flour into the potatoes until you have a ball of dough that you can knead and that is slightly tacky but not sticking to your hands.  If you feel you need more flour, add it a few tablespoons at a time.

Break off a small piece of dough the size of a grape and form it into a little ball.  Drop it into boiling water and if it holds together and does not fall apart, you have the right consistency; go ahead and make the rest of the gnocchi.

Lightly flour the work surface.  Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out until it is about 1/4 inch thick.  Use a 2-inch round cutter to cut circles; reroll the scraps to make more circles.  Place a half prune or apricot in the center of each circle.  Fold the circle in half to form a half-moon shape.  Use a fork to seal the edges.  This is important because there is nothing worse than gnocchi that come apart as they are boiled.

As you make the gnocchi, place them on a towel lined baking sheet; do not stack them one on top of the other.

Have a large pot of boiling water ready and in a smaller pot, melt the butter and keep it warm.

Cook the gnocchi in batches until they rise to the surface; remove them with a slotted spoon to a serving platter and keep them warm while you finish cooking the rest.

Pour the melted butter over the gnocchi and sprinkle them with the cheese and the cinnamon.  Toss gently and serve at once.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Here is a recipe for wonderful tasting prune gnocchi made for me at Le Noci in Grutti.  Why not make them for your family and keep the filling a surprise?

Comments:  Emilio Maddaloni dishes up his Italian heritage every day in the foods he prepares for his customers.  Walking into his store in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with the stand-up lunch bar is a true leap back in time when things were simple, friendships meant more than schedules, and lunchtime stretched into hours of conversationjust remembering.  Emilio often makes the meatless dishes of his childhood, which his mother created from nothing and are today the most popular with his clientele.  One of his specialties is his mother's angel hair pasta with anchovies, which he further enlivens with jalapeño peppers.  Not only is this dish very tasty, it is very quick and, according to Emilio, even better at 3 A.M.

Comments:  Emilio Maddaloni dishes up his Italian heritage every day in the foods he prepares for his customers.  Walking into his store in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with the stand-up lunch bar is a true leap back in time when things were simple, friendships meant more than schedules, and lunchtime stretched into hours of conversationjust remembering.  Emilio often makes the meatless dishes of his childhood, which his mother created from nothing and are today the most popular with his clientele.  One of his specialties is his mother&apos;s angel hair pasta with anchovies, which he further enlivens with jalapeño peppers.  Not only is this dish very tasty, it is very quick and, according to Emilio, even better at 3 A.M.

          Fresh Vegetable Lasagne - {Lasagne Di Verdure Fresche}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  white onion -- diced
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     green bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and diced
  2             medium  zucchini -- diced
  1             medium  eggplant -- peeled and diced
     1/4           cup  minced fresh basil
     1/4           cup  minced flat-leaf parsley
  2             medium  potatoes -- cooked, peeled,
                        and diced
  1              pound  ripe tomatoes -- diced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  8                     no-boil lasagne noodles - (7" by 6 1/2")
  1                cup  diced Italian Fontina cheese
  1                cup  diced provolone cheese
  1                cup  diced mozzarella cheese
  2               cups  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or prepared sauce)

In a large saute pan, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic and cook until the onion begins to soften.  Add the pepper, zucchini, and eggplant and cook until the vegetables soften.  Stir in the basil and parsley.  Add the potatoes and tomatoes, stir well, and season with salt.  Cover the pan and let simmer until very soft, about 20 minutes.  Remove from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease a 14- by 8 1/2- by 2-inch baking pan with olive oil.

Place 2 lasagne sheets in the pan, slightly overlapping them.  Spoon about 2 cups of the vegetable mixture over the noodles.  Scatter the Fontina cheese over the vegetables.  Cover the cheese with 2 more lasagne noodles.  Spread another 2 cups of the vegetable mixture on top.  Scatter the provolone cheese over, cover with 2 more lasagne sheets, and top with the remaining vegetable mixture.  Scatter the mozzarella cheese over the vegetables and top with the remaining 2 lasagna sheets.

Press down on the top sheets with your hands to compact the layers.  Spread the tomato sauce over the top.  Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.

Let the lasagne cool for about 5 minutes before cutting into squares.  Serve immediately.

Note:  Cooked lasagne can be frozen for as long as 3 months.  Defrost in the refrigerator and reheat in a moderate oven for 20 to 30 minutes.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  A medley of just-picked summer vegetables layered between thin sheets of lasagne noodles gives this dish its garden-fresh taste.  I like to use Del Verde brand no-boil lasagne sheets.  For this recipe, you will need eight of the 7- by 6 1/2-inch sheets.  If using another brand, adjust the number of lasagne sheets as necessary to make four layers in the pan.

              Fried Pasta Wedges - {Frittelle Di Taglierini}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  butter
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  hot milk
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  celery salt
                        Grated zest of 1 large lemon
  4              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmigiano­Reggiano cheese
  1                cup  diced cooked vegetables
                        = (such as green beans, asparagus, or
                        artichoke hearts, or a combination of
                        vegetables)
     1/2         pound  fresh or store-bought taglierini or
                        angel hair pasta
  1 1/2           cups  toasted bread crumbs - (to 2)
     1/2           cup  vegetable oil -- for frying

Melt the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat.  Gradually whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute.  Slowly whisk in the hot milk, then cook the mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens and coats the spoon, about 4 minutes.  Stir in the salts and zest, remove from the heat, and quickly whisk in two of the eggs, one at a time.  Stir in the cheese.  Pour the sauce into a large bowl, stir in the veg­etables and press a sheet of buttered wax paper onto the surface of the sauce to keep a skin from forming and set aside.

Cook the taglierini according to the directions.  Drain well and add to the sauce, mixing thoroughly to coat the pasta well.  Turn the mixture out onto a lightly oiled cookie sheet or marble board.  Shape the mixture into an even-looking round, about 10 inches in diameter and 1 inch high.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.  This will make it easier to cut into wedges before frying.

Beat the remaining 2 eggs in a shallow, wide bowl.  Mound the bread crumbs on a sheet of wax paper and season them with a little salt.

With a sharp knife, cut the round into quarters; cut each quarter into two wedges.  Dip each wedge into the egg, evenly coating it, then coat it in bread crumbs and set aside on a cookie sheet.

Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy-duty skillet over medium-high heat.  Fry the wedges on both sides until the coating is crisp and browned.  Add additional oil if the pan seems too dry.  Remove the wedges with a slotted spatula and let them drain on brown paper.  Serve warm.

Note:  These are also good topped with a little tomato sauce.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Frittelle usually means small pieces of batter-fried foods.  Here it means crunchy fried wedges of thin taglierini (similar to angel hair) that are held together in a cream-and-vegetable sauce.  The nice thing about this recipe is that the taste and texture can easily change with what's in the refriger­ator.  Small pieces of cooked vegetables such as artichoke hearts or asparagus are delicious additions, as are a handful of fresh herbs.  For a nice change of pace, serve frittelle as a Sunday night supper and you will be surprised at how good it can taste as a leftover.  To save time, assemble the entire dish up to the point of coating the frittelle in egg and bread crumbs and refrigerate it.

                   Fried Penne - {Pennette In Padella}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      First Course
                Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  5 1/2    tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  pennette rigate
  6        tablespoons  brandy
  4             ounces  shiitake mushrooms -- chopped
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
  3 1/2           cups  hot chicken broth
  6        tablespoons  heavy cream
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper

Place the porcini mushrooms in a small bowl, cover with cold water, and soak for about 30 minutes or until they are soft.  Drain the porcini, dice them, and set aside.  Reserve the liquid.

In a skillet at least 14 inches wide and 2 inches deep, heat 3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil until hot.  Add the pennette and brown quickly, about 7 or 8 minutes, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon.  Be careful not to burn them.  They should look unevenly toasted.  Add the brandy, continue to stir, and let the alcohol evaporate.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.

In a separate skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, add the porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and saute for about 3 minutes.  Add the parsley, saute 1 minute more, and set aside.

Return the skillet with the pennette to the heat.  Add enough broth to almost cover them, plus 1/2 cup reserved soaking liquid.  Stir the mixture well, bring to a boil, cover the pan, lower the heat, and cook for 6 or 7 minutes, stirring often.  The pennette should be cooked only until very al dente, almost crunchy.

Uncover the pan, raise the heat, and let the remaining liquid almost totally evaporate.  Add the mushroom and parsley mixture, combining well, then add the cream and cheese, and continue to stir and cook for 1 minute.  Add the salt and pepper, mix well, and serve immediately.

Note:  Use the smallest penne you can find; you probably won't be able to find the tiny variety that the recipe traditionally uses.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 first-course servings.

Comments:  Pennette is a type of macaroni that resembles small quill pens.  They are either ridged (pennette rigate) or smooth, and vary in length.  For this dish, a specialty of Tre Vaselle, a charming hotel and cooking school nestled among the Lungarotti vineyards of Torgiano, the pennette are no more than 1/4-inch long.  The method of browning the pasta first makes an unusual, but hearty dish.

Place the porcini mushrooms in a small bowl, cover with cold water, and soak for about 30 minutes or until they are soft.  Drain the porcini, dice them, and set aside.  Reserve the liquid.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a skillet at least 14 inches wide and 2 inches deep, heat 3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil until hot.  Add the pennette and brown quickly, about 7 or 8 minutes, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon.  Be careful not to burn them.  They should look unevenly toasted.  Add the brandy, continue to stir, and let the alcohol evaporate.  Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a separate skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, add the porcini and shiitake mushrooms, and saute for about 3 minutes.  Add the parsley, saute 1 minute more, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Return the skillet with the pennette to the heat.  Add enough broth to almost cover them, plus 1/2 cup reserved soaking liquid.  Stir the mixture well, bring to a boil, cover the pan, lower the heat, and cook for 6 or 7 minutes, stirring often.  The pennette should be cooked only until very al dente, almost crunchy.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Uncover the pan, raise the heat, and let the remaining liquid almost totally evaporate.  Add the mushroom and parsley mixture, combining well, then add the cream and cheese, and continue to stir and cook for 1 minute.  Add the salt and pepper, mix well, and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Use the smallest penne you can find; you probably won&apos;t be able to find the tiny variety that the recipe traditionally uses.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 6 to 8 first-course servings.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Comments:  Pennette is a type of macaroni that resembles small quill pens.  They are either ridged (pennette rigate) or smooth, and vary in length.  For this dish, a specialty of Tre Vaselle, a charming hotel and cooking school nestled among the Lungarotti vineyards of Torgiano, the pennette are no more than 1/4-inch long.  The method of browning the pasta first makes an unusual, but hearty dish.

                   Fried Sage Leaves - {Salvia Fritta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  cornstarch
     1/3           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  unflavored sparkling water
  16                    fresh sage leaves -- stemmed
                        Vegetable oil -- for frying
                        Fine sea salt -- as needed

Sift the cornstarch and flour together into a small bowl.  Stir in the sparkling water.  Cover the bowl and let it stand for 2 hours.

Add the sage leaves to the batter and coat them well using a spoon.

Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a heavy-duty saucepan until it reaches 375 degrees.  Use a thermometer to test, or drop a bit of the batter into the oil; if it browns immediately the oil is hot enough.

Drop the leaves a few at a time into the oil and fry them until they are golden brown.  With a slotted wooden spoon, remove the leaves to a dish lined with paper towels.

Sprinkle the leaves with salt and serve hot.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Alla Borsa, one of my favorite restaurants, is in Valeggio Sul Mincio near Verona.  It serves a wonderful antipasto of fried sage leaves -- a crispy and delightful surprise, and very addictive.  I eat them like potato chips.  Make the batter at least 2 hours ahead of time to allow it to thicken sufficiently, and use only fresh sage leaves.  Serve with chips of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, some cured olives, and a good Pinot Grigio wine.  This makes a delicious and effortless beginning to an evening meal.

                     Fried Semolina - {Semola Fritta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4         pound  pancetta -- diced
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  4 1/4           cups  diced white onion - (2 large)
  4               cups  hot water
  12            ounces  fregola (semolina grossa)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  diced sopressata or Genoa salami
                        Pecorino cheese -- for sprinkling

In a large pan saute the pancetta with the olive oil over low heat until the pancetta begins to crisp, about 4 minutes.  Add the onions and cook them slowly until they begin to brown.  Pour in the hot water, bring the mixture to a boil, cover the pot, and boil for 15 minutes.

Stir in the fregola and mix well with a wooden spoon so they do not stick.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until all the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes.  The semolina should be al dente, not mushy; the grains should not be gummy.  Stir in the salt and salami.  Transfer the mixture to a serving dish, sprinkle on the cheese and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Semola Fritta is another traditional Sardinian dish made with fregola.  Large-size couscous, which is similar to fregola, can be used.  The original recipe calls for fresh lard but the substitution of pancetta combined with the taste of spicy salami more than compensates for the omission.  The name "semola fritta" is a curious one, since the fregola are not fried at all.

                                Garganelli

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3              large  eggs
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour

Whirl the eggs, cheese, and nutmeg together in a food processor until smooth.  Gradually add the flour until a ball of dough is formed that leaves the sides of the bowl.  Gather up the dough, shape it into a ball, and let it rest, covered, under a bowl for about 1 hour.

Alternately, make the dough by hand.  Heap the flour onto a work surface and fashion it into a fontana.  Crack the eggs into the center of the fontana and break them up with a fork.  Beat in the cheese and nutmeg.  Form the dough by slowly incorporating the flour into the egg mixture.

When ready to roll and form the garganelli, cut the dough into four pieces; work with one piece at a time, keeping the rest covered.  Roll out each piece, using a hand-crank pasta machine or by hand using a rolling pin.  Trim the sheet to 24 inches long.  The sheet should be about 6 inches wide.  With a pasta wheel, cut the sheet in half lengthwise, then cut eight 3-inch squares from each half.  There should be sixteen 3-inch squares.  Save and reroll the scraps.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

Place a new unsharpened pencil or small 1/4-inch-wide wooden dowel rod diagonally at a point at one end of the pasta and roll the pasta up on the pencil or dowel rod.  Create lines on the garganelli by rolling the pasta over a new clean comb, a butter paddle, or a chitarra.  Slip the garganelli off the end of the pencil or rod and let them dry on clean kitchen towels for about 30 minutes before cooking.

Note:  Garganelli are best cooked the day they are made.  Drying them for future use makes them too hard to cook uniformly.

This recipe makes at least 6 dozen, yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Garganelli, which means "small esophagus", is a pasta from Emilia-Romagna that is difficult to find outside of that region.  Admittedly, it takes a bit of time and patience to hand-form the pointed tubular shape that resembles penne, but they are so delicious that I encourage you to try them.  The nutmeg-and-Parmesan-cheese-flavored dough is easily made in a food processor and is smooth and elastic.  Allowing the dough to rest, covered, for about 1 hour, makes it easy to roll either in a pasta machine or by hand.

             Garganelli With Asparagus And Cheese Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  asparagus
  1 1/4      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- diced
  1 1/3           cups  light cream
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1             recipe  Garganelli -- (see recipe)

Wash the asparagus and bend the stem with your hands; it will break at just the right point.  Discard the woody stems and cut the asparagus in half.  Set aside.

Fill a 1-quart saucepan with water and bring to a boil.  Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and the asparagus.  Cook, uncovered, just until a knife easily pierces the stalk, about 5 minutes.  Drain the asparagus in a colander and set aside.  (This step can be done ahead and the asparagus refrigerated covered until ready to use.)

Melt the butter in a medium-size saute pan, taking care not to let it brown.  Add the prosciutto and cook slowly over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the prosciutto is crisp and browned.  Remove the prosciutto with a slotted spoon to a dish lined with paper towels.  (This step can be done several hours ahead.)  Wash out and dry the saute pan.

Pour the cream into the saute pan and at low heat stir in the cheese.  Stir in the asparagus.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt just before cooking the garganelli.

Cook the garganelli according to the instructions.  Drain the garganelli when al dente, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water, and transfer them to a serving platter.  Stir the reserved water into the sauce and pour the sauce over the garganelli.  Use two serving spoons to mix and evenly distribute the sauce.  Scatter the prosciutto over the top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Garganelli, a handmade tubular-shaped pasta with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese in the dough, gets its classic shape from a comblike device called a pettine, which is used to create lines in the dough.  Garganelli are usually served with a butter or tomato sauce, but I also like this cream sauce with crispy bits of prosciutto and asparagus.  Serve garganelli as an elegant first course for a dinner party.  Save time by cooking the asparagus and making the sauce ahead.

Wash the asparagus and bend the stem with your hands; it will break at just the right point.  Discard the woody stems and cut the asparagus in half.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a 1-quart saucepan with water and bring to a boil.  Add 1 teaspoon of the salt and the asparagus.  Cook, uncovered, just until a knife easily pierces the stalk, about 5 minutes.  Drain the asparagus in a colander and set aside.  (This step can be done ahead and the asparagus refrigerated covered until ready to use.)
</DirT>
<DirT>
Melt the butter in a medium-size saute pan, taking care not to let it brown.  Add the prosciutto and cook slowly over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the prosciutto is crisp and browned.  Remove the prosciutto with a slotted spoon to a dish lined with paper towels.  (This step can be done several hours ahead.)  Wash out and dry the saute pan.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Pour the cream into the saute pan and at low heat stir in the cheese.  Stir in the asparagus.  Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt just before cooking the garganelli.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the garganelli according to the instructions.  Drain the garganelli when al dente, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water, and transfer them to a serving platter.  Stir the reserved water into the sauce and pour the sauce over the garganelli.  Use two serving spoons to mix and evenly distribute the sauce.  Scatter the prosciutto over the top and serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

<DirT>
Comments:  Garganelli, a handmade tubular-shaped pasta with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese in the dough, gets its classic shape from a comblike device called a pettine, which is used to create lines in the dough.  Garganelli are usually served with a butter or tomato sauce, but I also like this cream sauce with crispy bits of prosciutto and asparagus.  Serve garganelli as an elegant first course for a dinner party.  Save time by cooking the asparagus and making the sauce ahead.

                     Half And Half Pasta Omelet - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt -- plus
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  1 1/2           cups  grated zucchini - (6 oz)
  1             medium  carrot -- grated
  1 1/2           cups  cubed Italian Fontina cheese - (6 oz)
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh mint leaves
  3             quarts  water
  6             ounces  plain fettucine
                        = (homemade or store-bought)
  6             ounces  spinach fettucine
                        = (homemade or store-bought)
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  butter

Crack three of the eggs into each of two large bowls.  Stir 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and a grinding of black pepper into each bowl.

Stir the zucchini into one bowl and the carrot into the other.  Divide equally and stir the cheese into each bowl.  Stir the nutmeg into the carrot mixture and the mint into the zucchini mixture.  Set the bowls aside.

In a pasta pot with an insert bring the water to a boil.  Add the 1 tablespoon of salt and the plain fet­tucine.  Cook for only 2 to 3 minutes for fresh or fol­low the directions for commercially prepared, being careful to cook the fettucine al dente.  With a pasta scoop, drain the fettucine from the water, shaking off the excess and transfer it to the bowl with the zucchini mixture.  Toss the ingredients gently together and set aside.

In the same pot, cook the spinach fettucine until al dente and drain with a pasta scoop, shaking off the excess water.  Transfer the fettucine to the bowl with the carrot mixture and toss well.  Set aside.

In a large (12-inch) nonstick saute pan, heat together 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and 1 table­spoon of the butter.  Make sure the oil and butter evenly coat the bottom of the pan.  Transfer the plain fettucine mixture to one half of the pan, smoothing out the top so it is even.  Pour the spinach fettucine mixture in the other half of the pan next to the plain fettucine and smooth the top.  Make sure the two types of fettucine meet in the center of the pan.  Cook over medium heat until the frittata easily moves away from the sides of the pan and moves freely when the pan is shaken.

Place a serving dish, pizza pan, or rimless baking sheet larger than the diameter of the saute pan over the top and carefully invert the frittata onto the dish or pan.  Set aside.  Return the saute pan to the heat.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 table­spoon butter and when it is hot, slide the under-cooked side of the frittata back into the pan and cook the other side.

Invert the frittata once it is cooked onto a serving dish.  Let cool slightly, then cut into wedges to serve.

Tip:  Use a lightweight well-seasoned nonstick saute pan for best results.  The frittata will be easier to invert and less likely to stick to the pan.

Note:  To make a low-fat, low-cholesterol version of this frittata, substitute commercially prepared fettucine, Egg Beaters (using 10 ounces for the 6 eggs), and low-fat cheese.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  A few olives, a handful of herbs, some chips of cheese, and last night's leftover pasta -- these are the things from which, in days gone by, frugal Italian cooks created a frittata, an omelet.  In this version, plain fettucine and spinach-flavored fettucine are combined with grated vegetables and cooked side by side in a large saute pan for a really gourmet look.  Although this dish is delicious made with commercially prepared fettucine, it is much lighter-tasting if made with homemade.  Capellini (angel hair pasta) is also a good choice.  Can't have eggs?  See the note at the end of the recipe about substituting Egg Beaters, low-fat cheese, and store-bought fettucine.

           Harlot-Style Spaghetti - {Spaghetti Alla Puttanesca}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  hot red pepper -- slit
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1                     tin anchovies - (2 oz) -- drained and chopped
  1              pound  ripe plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  capers -- rinsed, dried,
                        and chopped
     1/2           cup  chopped pitted oil-cured black olives
     1/4           cup  Dried Tomatoes In Olive Oil -- (see recipe)
  1              pound  spaghetti

In a large skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the pepper and garlic and cook, pressing on the pepper with a wooden spoon, until the garlic begins to color.  Remove the pepper and discard.  Add the anchovies and swirl them in the oil until they begin to dissolve.  Add the tomatoes, capers, and olives, and cook, covered, for 5 minutes more.

While the sauce cooks, puree the dried tomatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a blender or food processor.

Add the tomatoes to the sauce and cook, covered, for 5 minutes.  Turn the heat to very low to keep the sauce warm.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente.  Drain well and add to the sauce.  Toss the spaghetti in the sauce and turn out onto a platter.  Serve immediately.

Note:  To peel tomatoes, drop them into a pot of boiling water for 2 minutes.  Drain, cool, and slip off the skins.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Every Italian cook has a recipe for "harlot-style spaghetti", named for the hot red pepper that gives it quite a kick.  Assuming you have the staples on hand, including oil-cured black olives, anchovies, capers, and dried tomatoes, this colorful and spicy dish can be put together in twenty minutes.

Comments:  Every Italian cook has a recipe for &quot;harlot-style spaghetti&quot;, named for the hot red pepper that gives it quite a kick.  Assuming you have the staples on hand, including oil-cured black olives, anchovies, capers, and dried tomatoes, this colorful and spicy dish can be put together in twenty minutes.

             Homemade Fusilli - {Fusilli Casalinghi Trenette}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  4              large  eggs

Cut the dough into four pieces and work with one piece at a time, keeping the remaining pieces covered.

Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough, then thin it using a hand-crank pasta machine or a rolling pin until it is 1/8-inch thick.

Trim the dough to 27 inches long by 4 1/2 inches wide.  Cut six 4 1/2-inch squares from the dough, then cut the squares as for fettucine, using the cutter on a hand-crank pasta machine, or use a knife and cut 1/4-inch-wide strips.

Place the end of a strip of dough over an 8-inch-long metal skewer and wrap the pasta loosely around the skewer, leaving slightly open spaces as you wrap the dough.  (Another method is to simply pinch off pieces of dough the size of large peas, roll them under your hand until they are 6 to 7 inches long, and then wrap them around the skewer.)  Lay the skewers on a clean kitchen towel and allow to set for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Then slide the fusilli off the skewers and transfer them to clean towels.  Let them rest 20 minutes before cooking or dry them thoroughly for long storage; this may take up to 2 days.

Note:  Fusilli can be shaped into longer lengths by pinching off larger pieces of dough.

This recipe yields at least 22 dozen.

Comments:  There are many good brands of commercially prepared fusilli, and I often use them, but sometimes I like to make them using the basic pasta recipe or the recipe for Tagliatelle Verdi (spinach-flavored pasta).  The salsa di Pomodori Mozzarella ed Acciughe pairs wonderfully with the plain fusilli; pair the spinach-flavored fusilli with the Salsa di Besciamella.

          Large Stuffed Shells - {Conchiglioni Ripieni Al Forno}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === RAGU ===
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     3/4         pound  lean ground beef
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  1                cup  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        === WHITE SAUCE ===
  4 1/2           cups  low-fat milk
  8        tablespoons  butter - (1 stick)
     1/2           cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        === ASSEMBLY ===
  1                     box large 2" pasta shells - (12 oz)
     1/4           cup  milk
  1 1/2           cups  heavy cream
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.  Add the meat and cook, stirring, until browned.  Raise the heat to high, stir in the wine, and let most of it evaporate.  Lower the heat to medium, add the tomato sauce, and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes, or until thickened.  Set aside.

In a large saucepan scald the milk (bring to just under a boil).  Set aside.

In another large saucepan, melt the butter.  Whisk in the flour to make a smooth paste, and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute.  Slowly whisk in the hot milk, and cook, whisking, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Stir in the salt.  Remove from the heat, and stir in the ragu until well blended.  Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Lightly butter a 14- by 8-inch baking dish.  Using a spoon, fill the shells with the ragu mixture and place them close together in the baking dish.

In a bowl, combine the milk and heavy cream.  Slowly pour evenly over the shells.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top.  Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes.  Serve immediately.

This recipe makes 36 to 40 shells, yields 20 buffet or 8 to 10 pasta-course servings.

Comments:  The original recipe for these large stuffed pasta shells (conchiglioni) comes from the kitchen of Signora Alba d'Aurora in Rome.  I was a little skeptical scanning the ingredients -- so much heavy cream and butter.  I used low-fat milk for the besciamella (white sauce) and less cream.  One or two of these rich ragu-stuffed shells are very filling, and I recommend serving them as part of a buffet.  The shells are not cooked first but they are filled dry and then baked.  The entire dish can be assembled a day ahead and refrigerated, leaving just the final steps of adding cream and milk before baking.

        Large Two-Colored Butterflies - {Farfallone Di Due Colori}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PLAIN PASTA ===
  2                     extra-large eggs
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  6        tablespoons  finely-ground durum flour
                        === FOR THE BEET PASTA ===
  2                     extra-large eggs
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2 1/2    tablespoons  pureed cooked beets (about 1 small)
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- (2 to 2 1/2)

For making the plain pasta by hand, follow the directions for Handmade Pasta - {Pasta Fatta A Mano}.  Knead the dough until it is smooth and no longer sticky.  Place it under a bowl on a lightly floured surface and let it rest for 30 minutes.

To make the beet pasta, follow the directions for Pasta Fatta a Mano or for making the dough in a food processor, adding the pureed beets with the eggs.  Divide each dough into four balls.  Work with one piece of each color at a time; keep the rest covered.  Flatten each piece of dough with a rolling pin.  Thin the plain dough using a pasta machine set to the thinnest setting.  Trim the sheet to 22 inches square.  Likewise thin the beet dough and trim it to 22 inches square.

Place the sheet of beet dough on top of the plain dough and press down slightly with your hand to adhere the two together.  Roll the dough on the thinnest setting to 32 inches.  Cut the sheet crosswise in half to make two 16-inch-long sheets.  Cut each half in half again lengthwise with a pastry wheel to form two strips.  Cut eight 2-inch squares from each strip.  Re-roll the scraps to form more farfallone.

Pinch each piece together in the center with your fingers to form the butterfly or bow-tie shape, then twist one side of the bow tie under from the center so one half is plain-colored and the other is red.  Place on a clean kitchen towel.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  Let the farfalle dry for 30 minutes before cooking or let them dry completely for several days and store in airtight containers.

This recipe yields about 13 dozen.

Comments:  Bow-tie pasta is a favorite of children and is better known in Italian as farfalle (butterflies).  Farfallone are large butterflies and are fun to make from scratch, although there are very good commercially prepared brands on the market.  In this recipe, two doughs are made, one plain, the other flavored with pureed beets, and the two doughs are thinned sandwiched together for two-color butterflies.  Use the dough to make other sizes of farfalle.  Dried farfalle can be stored in an airtight jar for several months.  Use small butterflies (farfalline) in soup, serve farfalle or farfallone in a creamy besciamella sauce, or make an easy timballo.

            Little Cubed Bread Sauce - {La Salsa Di Briciole}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 3/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  hot red pepper -- broken into pieces
  1         tablespoon  minced garlic
  1 3/4           cups  very small-cubed stale bread
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/2           cup  chopped cherry tomatoes
  2              whole  basil leaves

Pour the olive oil into a sauté pan large enough to hold the bread cubes in a single layer.  Add the hot pepper and swirl in the oil pressing on the pieces with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the garlic and cook until it softens but does not brown.  Stir in the bread cubes and coat them in the oil but do not brown them; they should remain light golden.  Stir in the salt and keep the sauce warm while the pinci are cooking.

Drain the pinci, transfer them to a large platter and pour the sauce over the top.  Toss gently to coat all the strands with the sauce.  Sprinkle the tomatoes over the top and garnish with the basil leaves.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Comments:  Stale bread has new meaning in this sauce for pinci.  Use bread that has a coarse crumb, as it will hold its shape.  La Salsa di Briciole, literally, a sauce made with bits or morsels of bread, exemplifies the true definition of cucina povera, simple country cooking where the ingenuity of the cook and the lesson of "waste not, want not" holds firm belief in the Tuscan kitchen.

                 Little Ears With Dandelion Greens - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil -- plus
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  1 1/2         pounds  dandelion greens -- washed well,
                        and stemmed
     1/2           cup  diced scallions
  1                cup  diced seeded yellow bell pepper
  1              small  hot red or green pepper -- seeded and diced
                        = (or 2 tspns dried red pepper flakes)
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt - (to 1/2) -- to your taste
  1              pound  store-bought orecchiette

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Stir in the bread crumbs and "toast" the crumbs, stirring them in the oil until they are golden brown.  Transfer them to a bowl and stir in the cheese.  Set aside.  Wipe out the saute pan and set aside.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the dandelion greens, and cook, uncovered, for 6 to 7 minutes.  Drain in a colander; when cool, squeeze out as much water as possible, reserving 1/4 cup.  Transfer the greens to a cutting board and coarsely chop them.  There should be about 1 1/2 cups.  Set aside.

Heat the remaining 1/3 cup of the olive oil in the saute pan over medium heat.  Stir in the scallions and yellow and hot peppers and cook until the scallions look translucent and glazed.  Stir in the garlic and dandelion greens and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the black pepper and salt and set aside off the heat.

Cook the orecchiette according to the directions.  These will take a little longer to cook because of their thickness, so test occasionally for doneness.  Drain the pasta and transfer to the saute pan along with the reserved greens water.  Reheat the dandelion-and-orecchiette mixture, stirring quickly to combine everything well.  Transfer the mixture to a serving platter.  Sprinkle the bread-crumb-and-cheese mixture over the top and serve immediately.

Note:  This is a spicy dish; adjust the amount of salt and hot pepper to taste.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Orecchiette, little ears, is an endearing name given to pasta from Puglia, the region at Italy's heel.  The semolina-flour-and-water dough is still made by hand in many locales where small pieces of dough are rolled against the tip of a butter knife to form the traditional shape.  The classic accompaniment to orecchiette is cima di rape, a vibrant, bitter-tasting green, and the best I have ever eaten was at Ristorante Plaza in the beautiful city of Lecce.  But Pugliese cooks concoct many combinations, including peppery arugula, chickpeas, and tomato sauce.  In this recipe dandelion greens become a delicious partner to store-bought orecchiette.  Orecchiette are a thicker pasta, so the cooking time will be longer than for thinner forms.

       Little Ears With Fiddleheads, Gorgonzola, And Walnuts - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  fiddlehead ferns
  4               cups  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  sea salt
  2              large  leeks -- green tops
                        discarded, and root ends trimmed
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
     1/4           cup  dry white wine
     1/4         pound  Italian Gorgonzola cheese -- cut small pieces
                        Grinding of black pepper
  1              pound  orecchiette
     1/2           cup  chopped walnuts

Fill a bowl with cold water and soak the fiddleheads for a few minutes.  Then drain them and set aside.  Bring the 4 cups water to a boil in a medium-size saucepan.  Add the fiddleheads and 1 teaspoon of the salt.  Cook the fiddleheads, uncovered, just until the stems are tender, 5 to 8 minutes.  Drain them in a colander and set aside.

Cut the leeks in half lengthwise, then wash them well under running water to remove any sand.  Cut the leeks into slices and set aside.  There should be about 2 cups.

In a saute pan over medium heat, combine the butter and olive oil.  When the butter is melted, add the leeks and cook them, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften.  Add the fiddleheads and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Increase the heat to high and pour in the wine.  Allow the wine to evaporate.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the cheese, and stir until it melts.  Stir in the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pepper.  Keep the sauce warm while the orecchiette are cooking.

Cook the orecchiette according to the directions.  Drain them, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Return the orecchiette to the pot with the water.  Stir in the fiddlehead mixture over low heat, combining the mixture well.

Transfer the orecchiette and fiddlehead sauce to a platter and sprinkle the nuts over the top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Although orecchiette (little ears) are traditionally served with some type of bitter green such as cime di rape, I also like combining this interesting pasta shape with tender fiddlehead ferns.  Fiddleheads appear in the grocery store for a short time in spring.  Although this recipe is a departure from the traditional Pugliese types, the addition of leeks, Gorgonzola cheese, and walnuts makes this dish a delight to make and enjoy as cucina nuova (new cooking).

                 Lobster Ravioli - {Ravioli Con Aragosta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta                           Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Basic Egg Pasta
                        === LOBSTER FILLING ===
  2               cups  cooked lobster meat - (abt 12 oz)
  1              large  egg -- beaten
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1           teaspoon  white pepper
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2        tablespoons  finely-minced fresh parsley

To make the filling, with a knife, mince the lobster meat fine.  Put it in a bowl, add all the remaining filling ingredients, and mix well.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.

To make the ravioli using a form, first roll the dough through a pasta machine to the finest setting and cut into 13-inch lengths, or roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface as thin as possible and cut into strips approximately 5 inches by 13 inches.  Place one strip of dough over the bottom section of the ravioli form, making sure that the dough overlaps all the edges of the form by about 1/2 inch.  Use the top part of the form to make slight impressions in the dough.  Put 1 teaspoon of filling in each impression and cover with another sheet of dough.  Roll over the form with a rolling pin several times to seal the edges.  Trim the excess dough from around the form and save to reroll.  Shake the ravioli out through the holes in the form and place them in a single layer on a floured baking sheet or a clean towel.

If you prefer to make the ravioli without a form, roll each piece of dough through a pasta machine to the finest setting and cut each strip of dough in half; or roll the dough out on a floured surface as thin as possible and cut in 5-inch-wide strips.  Place teaspoons of the filling about 2 inches apart on one strip of dough, and cover with another strip of dough.  Press down around the mounds of filling to seal the dough, and cut in ravioli squares with a pasta wheel or sharp knife.  Place the ravioli in a single layer on a floured baking sheet or clean towels as you make them.

To cook, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook the ravioli, about 2 dozen at a time, just until they bob to the top, about 3 minutes.  Drain and serve with a sauce of your choice.

To freeze, arrange the ravioli on baking sheets in a single layer, cover with foil, and freeze until solid.  Place them in plastic bags and freeze for up to 3 months.  Do not defrost before boiling.

Note:  Ravioli forms can be purchased in cookware shops or through catalogs.

This recipe yields 150 to 200 ravioli.

Comments:  It is interesting to conjecture as to how ravioli came to be.  These plump little pillows of pasta hold a variety of traditional savory fillings, depending on where in Italy you are.  My Grandmother Galasso used to make ravioli out of leftover pasta dough that was too small to do anything else with.  She filled them with a mixture of bits and pieces of meats, cheeses, and herbs.  Then they were gently placed on a clean blanket until the cooking water was boiling.  When I make ravioli and I really want to splurge, I fill them with lobster.  I like to serve them with Red Pepper Sauce (Salsa Di Peperoni Rossi).  This recipe makes a lot:  Cook what you need and freeze the rest.

To make the filling, with a knife, mince the lobster meat fine.  Put it in a bowl, add all the remaining filling ingredients, and mix well.  Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To make the ravioli using a form, first roll the dough through a pasta machine to the finest setting and cut into 13-inch lengths, or roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface as thin as possible and cut into strips approximately 5 inches by 13 inches.  Place one strip of dough over the bottom section of the ravioli form, making sure that the dough overlaps all the edges of the form by about 1/2 inch.  Use the top part of the form to make slight impressions in the dough.  Put 1 teaspoon of filling in each impression and cover with another sheet of dough.  Roll over the form with a rolling pin several times to seal the edges.  Trim the excess dough from around the form and save to reroll.  Shake the ravioli out through the holes in the form and place them in a single layer on a floured baking sheet or a clean towel.
</DirT>
<DirT>
If you prefer to make the ravioli without a form, roll each piece of dough through a pasta machine to the finest setting and cut each strip of dough in half; or roll the dough out on a floured surface as thin as possible and cut in 5-inch-wide strips.  Place teaspoons of the filling about 2 inches apart on one strip of dough, and cover with another strip of dough.  Press down around the mounds of filling to seal the dough, and cut in ravioli squares with a pasta wheel or sharp knife.  Place the ravioli in a single layer on a floured baking sheet or clean towels as you make them.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To cook, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Cook the ravioli, about 2 dozen at a time, just until they bob to the top, about 3 minutes.  Drain and serve with a sauce of your choice.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To freeze, arrange the ravioli on baking sheets in a single layer, cover with foil, and freeze until solid.  Place them in plastic bags and freeze for up to 3 months.  Do not defrost before boiling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Ravioli forms can be purchased in cookware shops or through catalogs.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 150 to 200 ravioli.

Comments:  It is interesting to conjecture as to how ravioli came to be.  These plump little pillows of pasta hold a variety of traditional savory fillings, depending on where in Italy you are.  My Grandmother Galasso used to make ravioli out of leftover pasta dough that was too small to do anything else with.  She filled them with a mixture of bits and pieces of meats, cheeses, and herbs.  Then they were gently placed on a clean blanket until the cooking water was boiling.  When I make ravioli and I really want to splurge, I fill them with lobster.  I like to serve them with Red Pepper Sauce (Salsa Di Peperoni Rossi).  This recipe makes a lot:  Cook what you need and freeze the rest.

            Macaroni Made On The Guitar With Lamb Sauce - ...

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled, halved
  2        tablespoons  fresh rosemary leaves
  2        tablespoons  fresh thyme leaves
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              small  hot red pepper -- seeded, and
                        cut into thin strips
  2             medium  red bell peppers -- seeded, and
                        cut into thin strips
  1                     bay leaf
  1              pound  ground lamb
     2/3           cup  dry red wine
  1              pound  fresh plum tomatoes -- seeded and chopped
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === PASTA ===
  1             recipe  Handmade Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
                        = (or 1 pound store-bought spaghetti)
                        Freshly-grated Pecorino cheese -- for sprinkling

To make the sauce, mince the garlic, rosemary, and thyme together and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a medium-size saute pan, add the minced mixture, and cook over medium heat until it begins to soften.  Add the peppers and bay leaf and continue to cook for about 1 minute.  Add the lamb, browning it slowly over medium heat.  Raise the heat to medium-high, add the wine, and stir with a wooden spoon until most of the wine has evaporated.

Stir in the tomatoes, salt, and pepper and mix well.  Cover the pan, reduce the heat to low, and simmer the sauce for 30 minutes, removing the cover during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Discard the bay leaf before using the sauce.  Remove 2 cups of the sauce, cool, and store for future use.  Keep the rest of the sauce warm while the maccheroni is cooking.  (Makes 4 cups)

Divide the dough into six pieces.

If you have a chitarra, roll each piece of dough out on a lightly floured work surface until it is one third shorter than the length of the chitarra.  Place the sheet of dough on top of the chitarra and roll over it forcefully with a rolling pin.  The maccheroni will fall beneath the chitarra.  Place the maccheroni on clean kitchen towels and continue with the rest of the dough.  Alternately, thin the dough using a hand-crank pasta machine to the next-to-the-thinnest setting, then place it over the chitarra and roll over it with a rolling pin.  If you do not have a chitarra, cut the pasta using a hand-crank pasta machine or by hand into very narrow strips, between 1/8 and 1/16 of an inch wide.

Cook the fresh maccheroni for about 3 minutes and 3 to 4 minutes for store-bought pasta, until it is al dente.  Drain the maccheroni, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Return the maccheroni to the pot, add the sauce and the reserved cooking water, and stir well.  Transfer the mixture to a serving platter.  Serve immediately and pass the cheese for sprinkling on top.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  One of my treasured pasta-making implements is the handmade wooden chitarra that belonged to my grandmother, Maria Assunta Saporito.  The chitarra is a rectangular form strung with taut, thin wire strings that is used for cutting the classic Abruzzese pasta known as maccheroni alla chitarra, which is a little thicker cut of spaghetti.  Chitarra means guitar and the implement is so called because as pasta sheets are rolled over it, the wires produce melodic sounds.  The appropriate sauce to use with this pasta is a lamb ragù made with both sweet and hot peppers, which can be made several days ahead to save time.  Two cups of sauce is enough to dress one recipe of the pasta.  Freeze the remaining sauce for future use.

The chitarra is also handy for making quadrucci, tiny squares of pasta used for soup.

       Macaroni With Bolognese Sauce - {Maccheroni Alla Bolognese}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1              pound  lean ground pork
     1/4         pound  piece pancetta -- diced
  1                     onion -- peeled and diced
  1                     carrot -- diced
  1                     celery rib -- diced
  1 1/2    tablespoons  flour
  1 1/2           cups  hot chicken broth
  4                     chicken livers -- washed and diced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1              pound  short-cut pasta with lines
                        = (such as rigatoni or ziti)
  4        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

In a 10- or 12-inch saute pan, combine the butter, pork, pancetta, onion, carrot, and celery, and cook the mixture, stirring often, until the pork has turned gray in color and the onions have softened.

Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir in.  Pour in the chicken broth, cover the pan, and simmer the mixture for 30 minutes.  Uncover the pan, stir in the chicken livers, cover the pan again, and cook for an additional 5 minutes over low heat.  Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.  Set it aside and keep it warm while the pasta is cooking.

Cook the pasta in 4 to 6 quarts of salted, boiling water until it is al dente; pasta should retain its shape and not collapse on itself and when cut into, no trace of white flour should remain.  Drain the pasta and transfer it to a serving dish.  Pour the sauce over the top and toss it well.  Sprinkle on the cheese and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This robust Bolognese sauce made with ground pork, pancetta, and chicken livers is perfect for short cuts of pasta such as rigatoni.  The sauce ingredients simmer for 30 minutes; this is in sharp contrast to other types of Bolognese sauces that need to cook slowly for at least two hours or until they are very concentrated.  Resist the temptation to add too much salt to this sauce, as the pancetta provides just enough.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                     eggplant - (abt 12 oz) -- peeled and diced
  1         tablespoon  water - (to 2)
  1 1/4           cups  fresh bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  minced fresh Italian parsley leaves
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1 1/2      teaspoons  dried oregano
  2              large  eggs -- slightly beaten
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino cheese
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  3               cups  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe), kept
                        hot
  1              pound  macaroni

Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or saucepan and slowly cook the garlic over medium heat until golden.  Add the eggplant and 1 tablespoon of the water, cover, and steam the eggplant over low heat until very soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining water only if the eggplant begins to stick to the skillet.  Stir the eggplant occasionally while it cooks.  Set the eggplant aside and let it cool.

Combine the bread crumbs, parsley, salt, oregano, eggs, and cheese in a large bowl.  Stir in the eggplant, mix well, and let it stand for 20 minutes.  Scoop small amounts of the mixture into your hands and form meatballs the size of a small egg.  There should be enough to make about eighteen.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large saute pan, over medium-high heat, then fry the meatballs, turning them occasionally so they brown evenly, or bake them in an oiled casserole dish in a preheated 350 degree oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes.  Transfer the meatballs to the tomato sauce and keep hot.

Cook the macaroni according to the package directions.  Drain and place the macaroni in a serving dish.  Mix with some of the tomato sauce, then arrange the meatballs and sauce on top of the pasta, and serve immediately.  Pass additional cheese for sprinkling on top.

Note:  When forming the meatballs, wet your hands occasionally to prevent the mixture from sticking.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Heat the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or saucepan and slowly cook the garlic over medium heat until golden.  Add the eggplant and 1 tablespoon of the water, cover, and steam the eggplant over low heat until very soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the remaining water only if the eggplant begins to stick to the skillet.  Stir the eggplant occasionally while it cooks.  Set the eggplant aside and let it cool.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Combine the bread crumbs, parsley, salt, oregano, eggs, and cheese in a large bowl.  Stir in the eggplant, mix well, and let it stand for 20 minutes.  Scoop small amounts of the mixture into your hands and form meatballs the size of a small egg.  There should be enough to make about eighteen.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the vegetable oil in a large saute pan, over medium-high heat, then fry the meatballs, turning them occasionally so they brown evenly, or bake them in an oiled casserole dish in a preheated 350 degree oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes.  Transfer the meatballs to the tomato sauce and keep hot.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the macaroni according to the package directions.  Drain and place the macaroni in a serving dish.  Mix with some of the tomato sauce, then arrange the meatballs and sauce on top of the pasta, and serve immediately.  Pass additional cheese for sprinkling on top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  When forming the meatballs, wet your hands occasionally to prevent the mixture from sticking.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  boiled ham -- cut thinly into
                        approximately 4 1/2" by 6" long slices
  1              ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
                        Warm water -- for soaking
                        mushrooms - just enough to cover them
  1                     carrot -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  1                     celery stalk -- cut into chunks
  1              small  onion -- peeled, and
                        cut into chunks
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1         tablespoon  butter
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
  1              pound  ground beef
  1         tablespoon  tomato paste
  1              pound  canned peeled tomatoes - (2 1/4 cups)
  2        tablespoons  minced parsley
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  6               cups  chicken or beef broth
  2 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
  5        tablespoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1         tablespoon  butter
     1/4           cup  heavy cream

Lightly butter a 9- by 2 1/4-inch ring mold.  Line the mold with the ham slices, overlapping them slightly so no gaps appear, and allow a 2-inch overhang over the rim of the mold.  Cover the mold loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until ready to fill.

Place the mushrooms in a bowl, cover them with warm water, and let them soak for 30 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid.  Dice the mushrooms and set them aside.

Mince the carrot, celery, and onion together with a chef's knife.

Heat the oil and butter in a saucepan, stir in the carrot, celery, and onion and cook the vegetables over low heat until they are soft.  Stir in the garlic and cook it until it begins to soften.  Stir in the ground beef and cook it until it looses its pink color.

In a bowl, mix together the tomatoes, tomato paste, and 1/2 cup of the reserved porcini liquid and add to the beef mixture.  (Save the remaining porcini liquid to use when making soups or stocks.)  Stir in the parsley, salt, and pepper.  Cover the pan and simmer the ragù for 1 1/2 hours.  Ten minutes before the ragù is cooked, stir in the mushrooms.  The consistency of the mixture should be very thick with almost no liquid.  Keep the ragù warm while the rice is cooking.

Bring the broth to a boil in a soup pot.  Stir in the rice, cover, and cook it, stirring occasionally, until all the broth is absorbed.  Stir in the cheese, butter, and cream.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Pack the rice evenly into the mold.  Place the mold in a baking pan large enough to hold it and carefully pour hot water into the baking pan allowing it to come up to about 1 inch along the sides of the ring mold.  Bake for 25 minutes, or until the rice is hot.  Remove the mold from the water bath, and run a butter knife around the inside edge of the mold to loosen the ham and ensure that it will unmold.

Place a serving dish larger than the mold over the top and invert the mold onto the dish.  Fill the center of the mold with some of the ragù.  Put the remaining ragù in a bowl to pass separately.  To serve, cut the mold into wedges and spoon some of the ragù on the side.

This recipe yields one 9-inch mold.

Comments:  When I was first introduced to bomba di riso, I was very amused by the choice of words used to describe this impressive molded rice dish that is a staple in the kitchen of my friend Mara Neviani, who lives in Cavriago.  The origins of this dish are said to trace back to the town of Piacenza, where it is still prepared for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15th, known as Ferragosto.  The procedure calls for Arborio rice, the short-grain starchy rice used in risotto.  The rice is boiled in either chicken or beef broth, then packed into a ring mold that is lined with overlapping slices of cooked ham.  The center of the mold is filled with a meat ragù.  The contrasting tastes of delicately flavored rice and intensely flavored ragù is a delight.  This dish makes a great presentation for company.  The ragù can be made days ahead and the rice mold assembled a day prior to baking.

          Maria Pia's Tuna Pate - {Pate Di Tonno Alla Maria Pia}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === MAYONNAISE ===
  2                     egg yolks
  1              whole  egg
  1 1/4    tablespoons  Dijon type mustard
  1              pinch  salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
  3        tablespoons  lemon or lime juice
  1 3/4           cups  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === PATE ===
  4                     cooked potatoes -- cooled and peeled
  1                can  tuna packed in olive oil - (12 oz)
  2        tablespoons  capers in salt -- rinsed
  1              pinch  sea salt

In a food processor or blender, whirl together the egg yolks, egg, mustard, salt, pepper, and lemon or lime juice until smooth.  Dribble in the olive oil through the feed tube with the motor running until the mixture has a mayonnaise consistency.

Store the mayonnaise in a jar in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Puree the potatoes with the tuna, capers, reserving 2 for the eyes, and salt.

On a serving platter form the tuna mixture into the shape of a fish with your hands.  Frost the fish with the mayonnaise and insert the reserved capers for the eyes.

Maria Pia serves the pate with a green salad, or fresh peas and onions cooked in olive oil.  It is also good accompanied with thin slices of grilled bread.

Variation:  Use thin slices of cucumbers to create fish scales over the mayonnaise.

Lining a fish mold with plastic wrap and packing it with the pate mixture is another technique to getting the "fish" look for this recipe.  Simply remove the plastic wrap carefully after inverting the mold onto a serving dish.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

Comments:  As Maria Pia says "You must use the best tuna in olive oil," but a good store-bought mayonnaise may be substituted for homemade.

       Mario's Fregola With Clams - {Fregola Con Vongole Di Mario}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : First Course                    Italian
                Pasta                           Seafood
                Shellfish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  tiny fresh clams -- rinsed well
     1/4           cup  water
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/4           cup  fresh minced Italian parsley
  1                cup  fregola - (8 oz)
  1              pound  whole peeled plum tomatoes
  3 1/2           cups  hot chicken or beef broth
                        = (homemade or canned)
  2              whole  dried tomatoes in olive oil -- cut into pieces
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste

Place the clams and the water in a medium-size saute pan.  Cover the pan and cook over medium heat until the shells open.  Remove the clams with a slotted spoon to a dish and set aside until cool enough to handle.  Discard any that do not open.  Strain the cooking liquid through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into a bowl, measure out 1/2 cup, and set aside.  Shuck all but five of the clams, chop them coarsely, and set aside.

In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the garlic and 2 tablespoons of the parsley.  Cook, stirring often, until the garlic is deep golden brown (this will give added flavor to the fregola).  Add the fregola to the pan and stir to coat the grains well with the olive oil.  Add the tomatoes and chop them coarsely with a wooden spoon as you stir.

Gradually stir in 3 cups of the broth and the reserved clam juice, allowing the fregola to absorb the liquid as it cooks.  The fregola should plump up to double their size and be firm to the bite but cooked through.  Add additional broth only if the fregola are still too firm.  The fregola should take 20 to 25 minutes to cook.

Two or three minutes before the fregola is ready, add the dried tomatoes and the clams.  Stir to blend the ingredients well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the fregola to a serving bowl or deep platter.  Garnish with the reserved clams and sprinkle the remaining parsley over the top.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Fregola or fregula is a traditional grano duro (hard wheat flour) pasta from Sardinia that resembles couscous.  I was introduced to it by my good friends Mario and Giulia Cocco, who make their summer home in Cagliari, one of the four provinces of the island.  Mario, who was born in Sardinia, is fiercely proud of his heritage and this dish has been on his family's table for generations.  Originally made by hand, and traditionally the work of every bride-to-be, fregola is now commercially made and sold as fregola grossa (large grains) and fregola media (medium grains).  Fregola is most frequently served with arselle, the sweet clams of Sardinia.  Fregola is not cooked the conventional way in boiling water but added raw to a soffrito (saute) of olive oil, garlic, and parsley, and cooked slowly with the addition of hot broth and clam juice.  According to Mario, this is the best method of cooking and allows the fregola to absorb all the flavors of the ingredients.  As with any pasta, fregola should be cooked al dente.  It is delicious as a first course, a hearty lunch, and equally welcome as leftovers.  Fregola is available in Italian specialty stores or by mail order.

Place the clams and the water in a medium-size saute pan.  Cover the pan and cook over medium heat until the shells open.  Remove the clams with a slotted spoon to a dish and set aside until cool enough to handle.  Discard any that do not open.  Strain the cooking liquid through a cheesecloth-lined strainer into a bowl, measure out 1/2 cup, and set aside.  Shuck all but five of the clams, chop them coarsely, and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the garlic and 2 tablespoons of the parsley.  Cook, stirring often, until the garlic is deep golden brown (this will give added flavor to the fregola).  Add the fregola to the pan and stir to coat the grains well with the olive oil.  Add the tomatoes and chop them coarsely with a wooden spoon as you stir.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Gradually stir in 3 cups of the broth and the reserved clam juice, allowing the fregola to absorb the liquid as it cooks.  The fregola should plump up to double their size and be firm to the bite but cooked through.  Add additional broth only if the fregola are still too firm.  The fregola should take 20 to 25 minutes to cook.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Two or three minutes before the fregola is ready, add the dried tomatoes and the clams.  Stir to blend the ingredients well.  Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the fregola to a serving bowl or deep platter.  Garnish with the reserved clams and sprinkle the remaining parsley over the top.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 to 6 first-course servings.

Comments:  Fregola or fregula is a traditional grano duro (hard wheat flour) pasta from Sardinia that resembles couscous.  I was introduced to it by my good friends Mario and Giulia Cocco, who make their summer home in Cagliari, one of the four provinces of the island.  Mario, who was born in Sardinia, is fiercely proud of his heritage and this dish has been on his family&apos;s table for generations.  Originally made by hand, and traditionally the work of every bride-to-be, fregola is now commercially made and sold as fregola grossa (large grains) and fregola media (medium grains).  Fregola is most frequently served with arselle, the sweet clams of Sardinia.  Fregola is not cooked the conventional way in boiling water but added raw to a soffrito (saute) of olive oil, garlic, and parsley, and cooked slowly with the addition of hot broth and clam juice.  According to Mario, this is the best method of cooking and allows the fregola to absorb all the flavors of the ingredients.  As with any pasta, fregola should be cooked al dente.  It is delicious as a first course, a hearty lunch, and equally welcome as leftovers.  Fregola is available in Italian specialty stores or by mail order.

                    Mary Ann's Eggplant Lasagne - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled and minced
  1              large  white onion -- peeled and minced
  2               cans  plum tomatoes - (28 oz ea) -- crushed
     1/2           cup  water
     1/2           cup  dry red wine
  3                     fresh basil leaves - (to 4)
  1         tablespoon  sugar
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        === EGGPLANT ===
                        Peanut oil -- for frying
  1             medium  firm eggplant - (abt 8" to 9" long)
     1/2         pound  store-bought lasagne noodles
                        = (or 1/2 recipe Basic Egg Pasta)
  1              pound  mozzarella cheese -- sliced

Sauce:  In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil, add the garlic and onion, and saute until soft.  Lower the heat; add the tomatoes, water, wine, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper.  Simmer the mixture for 20 minutes.  Set aside.

Eggplant:  Wash and dry the eggplant.  Cut into 1/8-inch lengthwise slices and place in layers in a colander.  Sprinkle salt between the layers and let sit for 1 hour.  Rinse and dry the eggplant slices with a towel.

In a skillet, heat enough peanut oil to coat the bottom.  Add a few eggplant slices at a time and saute quickly, about 2 minutes on each side or until soft.  Drain the pieces on brown paper.  Set aside.

If using homemade pasta, cut the dough into 3 pieces.  Work with 1 piece at a time and roll the dough 1/8-inch thick.  Cut 2 sheets from each piece to fit a 9- by 13-inch lasagne pan.  Set aside on a floured towel in a single layer.

In a large pot, bring about 8 quarts of water to the boil.  Add a few homemade lasagne strips at a time and parboil for 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove the noodles to a waiting pan of ice water.  This will cool the noodles and allow you to handle them.  Continue cooking the remaining noodles in small batches.  Drain the noodles on dry towels.  (If using store-bought noodles, skip the parboiling step and layer the noodles uncooked.)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spread 1 cup of the sauce in the bottom of the lasagne pan.  Add a layer of lasagne strips.  Cover the strips with 1/2 cup sauce.  Add a layer of eggplant.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and add a layer of cheese.  Spread 1/2 cup of sauce over the cheese.  Make 2 more layers of lasagne strips, sauce, eggplant, salt and pepper, and cheese.  Spread the top layer with 1 cup sauce.  Cover the dish with foil and bake for 35 to 40 minutes.  Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.

Note:  Make a day ahead of serving.  After baking, remove the foil and cover the pan with a sheet of waxed paper, then replace the foil.  This prevents the acid in the tomato sauce from eating through the foil and leaving little bits of foil on the top of the sauce.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Lasagne is an ancient food.  The Romans were dishing it out during the heyday of the Roman Empire.  A fourteenth-century cooking manuscript directs the cook to boil the lasagne noodles (made without eggs) in capon broth and then layer the noodles with grated cheese.  In my version, freshly made noodles are layered with thin, lengthwise slices of eggplant and topped with tomato sauce.

            Molded Macaroni Casserole - {Timballo Di Maccarun}

Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4         pound  ground beef sirloin
     1/2         pound  ground veal
  2             slices  stale bread
  2              large  eggs -- slightly beaten
  3        tablespoons  minced fresh parsley
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     2/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  4               cups  cooked elbow macaroni - (2 cups dry)
  1 1/2           cups  diced mozzarella cheese
     1/2           cup  diced Provolone cheese
  2 1/2           cups  tomato sauce -- plus
                        extra as needed
                        Olive oil -- for greasing pan
  7                     lean slices prosciutto
                        = (or 1/4 lb pancetta)

In a bowl, gently combine the ground meats.  In a separate bowl of water, dip the bread slices just until softened, then squeeze out the water, crumble the bread, and add to the meats along with the eggs, herbs, salt, pepper, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Mix just to combine the ingredients.  Set aside.

In a separate bowl, combine the cooked macaroni with the remaining cheeses and 1 cup of tomato sauce.  Set aside.

Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with olive oil.  Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom of the pan.  Place the slices of prosciutto or pancetta in the bottom of the pan in a spoke-like or circle fashion.  Cover the slices and sides of the pan with about two thirds of the meat mixture.  Make sure there are no gaps.  Gently fill the center of the pan with the macaroni mixture, patting it down firmly.

With a rolling pin, roll the remaining meat mixture between 2 sheets of waxed paper to fit the top of the pan.  Remove 1 sheet of the waxed paper and invert the meat over the top of the pan.  Carefully pull back the remaining sheet of waxed paper.  Neatly press the edges of the meat all the way around the pan, making sure that there are no gaps.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cover the top of the pan tightly with a piece of aluminum foil.  Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes, covered.  Remove the foil and bake 15 minutes longer, or until the meat is browned on top.

Remove the pan from the oven.  Run a knife around the edges of the pan.  Place a serving platter over the pan and invert onto the platter.  With a potholder, carefully release the spring and lift off the sides of the pan.  Remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment paper.  Let the timballo cool for 5 to 10 minutes.

Serve the timballo cut into wedges and pass extra tomato sauce on the side.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Pasta means paste, something made from flour and water.  It has become a generic term when referring to all types of pasta, whether made from just flour and water or with eggs as well.  In southern Italy, pasta is called macaroni or maccarun, as was said at home.  The many shapes and sizes that macaroni come in are created by bronze die-plates that extrude the mixture of semolina flour and water, and give its artistic, final shape.  In this recipe the familiar elbow shape is used to make an impressive molded casserole called a timballo.

                        and diced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/3           cup  dry red wine
                        === DOUGH ===
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  3              large  eggs
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        === SAUCE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3              large  garlic cloves -- halved lengthwise
  1                cup  heavy cream
     1/3         pound  Italian Fontina cheese -- diced
     1/2      teaspoon  peppercorns -- crushed
                        = (preferably Tellichery)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the chili pepper and cook for about 5 minutes, pressing on the pieces and swirling them in the butter with a wooden spoon.  Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly browned, about 8 minutes.  Sprinkle the salt over the mushrooms and raise the heat to high.  Add the wine and let it evaporate.  Transfer the mushrooms to a blender or food processor and process to a paste.  Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Mound the flour on a work surface.  Make a well in the center and crack the eggs into the well.  Sprinkle the salt over the eggs and beat with a fork until blended.  Pushing the flour from the inside of the well into the center with your hands, gradually incorporate enough flour into the eggs to make a soft dough.

Push any excess flour aside, and knead the dough for 5 minutes, or until it is smooth.  Cover the dough with a bowl and let it rest for 10 minutes.

Divide the dough into 4 pieces.  To make the ravioli using a ravioli form, roll each piece out through a pasta machine set to the next-to-the-last-setting.  Cut the pasta into 13-inch lengths.  Place one sheet of dough over the bottom part of a ravioli form, and make impressions with the top piece of the form.  Fill each cavity with about 1/2 teaspoon of the mushroom filling.  Place a second sheet of dough over the top and toll over the dough with a rolling pin to create the ravioli.  Shake the ravioli out onto a clean towel, trim any excess dough from around the form and save to reroll.  Arrange them in a single layer.  Continue with the remaining dough and filling.

To make the ravioli by hand, roll each piece out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle about 1/8 inch thick.  Space 1/2 teaspoon of the filling about 1 1/2 inches apart on one sheet of dough.  Cover with another sheet of dough, press down around the mounds of filling with your fingers to seal, and cut into ravioli with a ravioli wheel.

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook, pressing on the cloves with a wooden spoon, until the garlic just begins to brown.  Add the Fontina, peppercorns, and cream, cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened.  Season the sauce with salt, cover and set aside.

Bring 8 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add half the ravioli at a time and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain well, and put them on a warm serving platter.

Meanwhile, reheat the sauce, stirring until smooth.  Pour the sauce over the ravioli and gently toss to coat them evenly.  Serve immediately.

Note:  The filling and sauce can be made 2 days ahead and refrigerated.  The uncooked ravioli can be frozen; place on cookie sheets in a single layer and freeze until hard.  Transfer to plastic bags and freeze.  Cook the ravioli unthawed.

This recipe makes 7 dozen ravioli, yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Portobello mushrooms can be as large as dinner plates.  They are exquisite when simply grilled, with a brushing of olive oil.  Creating more elaborate recipes with them is fun too.  I developed this mushroom-stuffed ravioli dish when a crate of the brown beauties arrived at my door.  To complement rather than overpower the woodsy taste of the filling, I teamed the ravioli with a cream and Italian Fontina cheese sauce.  I knew my efforts had paid off when I took the first bite.  If you cannot find portobello mushrooms, use cremini (smaller versions of portobellos) or shiitake mushrooms.  This dish makes an elegant first course for a bridal luncheon.

            Neapolitan Rice, Pork And Vegetable Mold - {Sartù}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pork                            Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  butter -- for greasing mold
  1                cup  toasted bread crumbs
                        === RICE MIXTURE ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  2               cups  Arborio rice
  4               cups  hot beef, chicken, or
                        vegetable broth - (to 5)
     3/4           cup  grated Pecorino cheese
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  2                     eggs
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  ground pork
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  2        tablespoons  grated Pecorino cheese
  1                     egg
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  3        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  diced onion
  8             ounces  button mushrooms -- wiped, and
                        sliced into thirds
  1                cup  fresh or frozen peas
                        Grinding of fresh black pepper

Generously butter the mold and coat it with the bread crumbs, pressing the bread crumbs into the mold if necessary.  Cover and chill the mold for several hours, or overnight if desired.

To prepare the filling, in a bowl combine the pork, bread crumbs, 1 teaspoon salt, cheese, and egg.  Mix gently with your hands to combine.  With wet hands form small meatballs the size of gum balls.

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan, and when it is hot brown the meatballs, in batches if necessary, until they are golden brown.  With a slotted spoon remove the meatballs to a bowl and set aside.  (At this point the meatballs can be refrigerated for 2 days in advance of assembling the dish.)

In the same saute pan melt 2 tablespoons of the butter, stir in onions, and cook them until they begin to wilt.  Stir in the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms exude their juices and they begin to brown.  Stir in the peas and cook for 1 minute.  Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and a grinding of black pepper.  Combine the mixture with the meatballs.

To prepare the rice mixture, melt the 3 tablespoons butter in a heavy-clad 3-quart saucepan, add the rice, and cook it over medium heat, stirring constantly, until all the brains of rice are coated in the butter.  Slowly pour in the broth, 1 cup at a time, and continue to stir and let the rice absorb each addition of liquid before adding more.  You may not need all the broth.  The rice should be firm but cooked through.  Stir in the grated cheese and remove the saucepan from the heat.  Let the rice cool slightly, then stir in the parsley and eggs.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Remove the mold from the refrigerator.  Line the bottom and the sides of the mold with about two-thirds of the rice mixture.  Make sure there are no bare spots.  Spoon the meatball mixture into the rice-lined mold.  Cover the top with the remaining rice, patting firmly to ensure the edges are sealed with rice.

Cover the mold with aluminum foil and bake it for 30 minutes.  Remove the aluminum foil and bake for another 10 minutes.  Remove the mold from the oven and let stand for about 5 minutes.  Have a serving dish or platter ready.  Place the dish on top of the mold.  Use potholders to hold onto the mold and gently turn the mold over and out onto the serving dish.  Do not remove the mold immediately.  Let it sit for a few minutes, then shake the mold to make sure that the rice has been released.  Lift the mold off and serve the sartù immediately.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  It was in Sorrento that I was first introduced to sartù, an impressive-looking rice mold with a meat and vegetable filling, but Naples lays claim to the dish.  Today sartù has many adaptations and has been simplified from the richer versions of the past, which contained chicken livers, sausages, cheeses, and assorted vegetables.  The most important thing to remember when making sartù is to prepare the mold well by coating it with butter and bread crumbs, and then chilling it thoroughly in the refrigerator.  The preparation, which can be done in stages, begins with making a risotto in which Arborio rice, a short-grain, starchy rice, is cooked slowly with the addition of hot broth.  The entire dish can be stored in the refrigerator for several hours or even overnight before baking.  Use a 10-cup ring mold or charlotte mold for best results.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA FROLLA (PASTRY DOUGH) ===
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  cake flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1              stick  cold unsalted butter -- cut into bits
  1              whole  extra-large egg -- slightly beaten
  1                     egg yolk
  5        tablespoons  ice water - (to 6)
  2        tablespoons  turbinado or raw sugar
                        === FILLING ===
  1                cup  long-grain rice
  2               cups  whole milk
  1              piece  vanilla bean - (3" long) -- slit lengthwise
  1              pound  ricotta cheese -- well drained
  3              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  freshly-squeezed orange juice
  2        tablespoons  grated orange zest
  1                cup  sugar
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon

Lightly spray a 10 1/2- by 1-inch tart pan with removable bottom with butter spray.  Set aside.

To prepare the dough, mix the all-purpose and cake flours, salt, and sugar in a food processor or bowl.  Add the butter to the flour mixture and pulse to blend if using a food processor, or use a pastry blender or fork to blend the ingredients by hand.  Add the whole egg and enough ice water to make a dough that is soft and not dry.  Do not overmix or the dough will be tough.  Gather the dough into a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap.  Chill the dough for 30 minutes.

To prepare the filling, pour the rice and milk into a 1-quart saucepan, scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean into the saucepan with a small knife, cover, and bring the rice to a boil.  Lower the heat to medium-low and continue cooking the rice until all the milk is absorbed.  This will take about 10 minutes.  Let the rice cool.

In a large bowl, beat the ricotta cheese, eggs, orange juice and zest, and sugar until smooth.  Stir in the vanilla extract and cinnamon.  Fold in the cooled rice.  Set the mixture aside.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Divide the dough in half.  Roll each half on a lightly floured surface into a 14-inch circle.  Line the tart shell with one rolled-out half and trim the edges even with the top sides of the tart pan.

Fill the tart shell with the ricotta and rice filling.  There will be a little of the filling left over.  This can be baked separately in a small ovenproof dish or in small ramekins.

Carefully roll the second sheet of dough loosely over the rolling pin and unroll it over the top of the filled tart.  Trim off the excess dough, making sure the edges are sealed.  Use the leftover dough to make a decorative pattern on top of the tart.  I use a small rabbit cutter to make cutouts for the top.

Brush the tart with the egg yolk and sprinkle the turbinado sugar evenly over the top.

Bake in the middle of the oven for 40 to 50 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the center of the tart.

Cool the tart on a rack, then carefully remove the sides of the tart pan and place the tart on a decorative serving dish.  Cut into wedges to serve.

Note:  Instead of orange juice and orange zest, candied fruits and raisins can also be used.

Variation:  The rice can also be cooked in 2 cups of water instead of milk.

Did you know that the Monday after Easter is called Pasquetta, Little Easter, in Italy and is a holiday almost a big as Easter?  It is a day for Italians to relax in the countryside.  Often a pastiera is brought along and enjoyed as picnic food.

This recipe yields one 10 1/2-inch pie.

Comments:  Easter pie (pastiera) is found all over Italy, but its origins are Neapolitan.  Tender pasta frolla pastry pies filled with fresh ricotta cheese and rice, sweetened with sugar, were made in batches, wrapped in clear cellophane, and given away as Easter gifts.  Many variations of this classic have survived; some use wheatberries or orzo (tiny pasta) in place of rice, but my favorite still remains the one from home, made with long-grain rice.  For the pasta frolla, I mix all-purpose flour with cake flour for a more delicate pie crust texture.  If you have a kitchen scale, weigh the flour for accuracy.  If you do not have a scale, lightly spoon the flour into a dry weight measuring cup, and level it at the top with a butter knife.

To prepare the dough, mix the all-purpose and cake flours, salt, and sugar in a food processor or bowl.  Add the butter to the flour mixture and pulse to blend if using a food processor, or use a pastry blender or fork to blend the ingredients by hand.  Add the whole egg and enough ice water to make a dough that is soft and not dry.  Do not overmix or the dough will be tough.  Gather the dough into a ball and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap.

            Pappardelle With Veal - {Pappardelle Con Vitello}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta                           Veal

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PASTA ===
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  3              large  eggs
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === VEAL SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  dried porcini mushrooms - (abt 1/2 oz)
  1                cup  hot water
     1/4           cup  olive oil -- plus
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1             medium  red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into thin strips
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  2               cups  sliced button mushrooms
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  3 1/2         pounds  veal shoulder blade -- boned, trimmed of
                        excess fat and sinew, and cut 1" pieces
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh sage
  1                cup  veal stock
  1                cup  dry red wine

Mound the flour on a work surface and sprinkle it with the salt.  Make a well in the center of the flour and add the eggs and olive oil.  Beat the eggs and oil with a fork until smooth, then gradually incorporate the flour from the inside walls of the well.  When the dough becomes too firm to mix with the fork, knead it with your hands, incorporating just enough of the flour to make a smooth ball of dough.  You may not need all the flour.

Push the excess flour aside and knead the dough for about 5 minutes, adding flour as needed.  Place the dough on a floured surface, cover with a bowl, and let rest for 10 minutes.

Cut the dough into 2 pieces.  Keeping the second piece covered, roll one piece with a rolling pin to flatten it slightly.  Roll out the dough through the rollers of a pasta machine on the thinnest setting.  Cut the strip into 9-inch lengths, then cut each piece lengthwise into 1 1/2-inch-wide strips.  Spread the pasta on floured towels while you roll out the remaining dough.  (To make the pappardelle by hand, roll each piece of dough into a 20- by 14-inch rectangle.  Cut lengthwise into 1 1/2-inch wide strips, then cut the strips in half crosswise.)

Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl, cover with the water, and let soak for 30 minutes.  Drain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid.  Cut the porcini into small pieces and set aside.  Strain the soaking liquid, and reserve half.

In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Add the onion and bell pepper and cook over low heat until the onion has softened.  Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes.  Remove the mixture to a medium bowl.  Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook, stirring, until they begin to brown.  Add them to the onions and peppers.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt, and pepper.  Add the veal pieces and toss well.  Shake off the excess flour and set the veal aside.

Heat the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in the skillet.  Add the veal and cook until browned on all sides.  Add the onion and pepper mixture, the porcini, the reserved soaking liquid, and the sage.  Add the veal stock and wine and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, cover, and simmer until the meat is tender, about 50 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the pappardelle and cook until al dente.  Drain the noodles and place on a large serving platter.

Spoon the veal and sauce over the noodles and toss gently.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Pappardelle are wide noodles that, in Tuscany, are usually teamed with a hare sauce.  In this country version, I use veal shoulder slowly simmered in red wine.  Use the veal bones to make veal stock, which gives an added layer of flavor to the sauce.  The pasta can be made one day in advance and placed on kitchen towels.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE FILLING ===
  2             pounds  ricotta cheese -- well drained
  1              small  zucchini -- grated (1 cup)
  1              small  carrot -- grated (1/2 cup)
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2        tablespoons  grated lemon zest - (2 large lemons)
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        === FOR THE PASTA ===
  1             recipe  Handmade Pasta dough -- (see recipe)
  1              large  egg white -- slightly beaten
                        Several sprigs fresh Italian parsley -- damp-wiped,
                        and stemmed
                        Several sprigs fresh small basil leaves -- damp-wiped,
                        and stemmed
  4             quarts  water
  1         tablespoon  salt
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  1                cup  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- melted
  1                cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Combine all the filling ingredients in a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

Divide the pasta dough into quarters; work with one quarter at a time and keep the rest covered under a bowl on a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for a few minutes on a lightly floured work surface.  Flatten the dough with a rolling pin, then thin it in a hand-crank pasta machine to the thinnest setting.  Trim the thinned dough to 30 inches long and cut it in half.  Save any scraps for re-rolling.

Lightly brush one half of the sheet with the beaten egg white.  Arrange a few leaves of parsley and basil along the length of the sheet, pressing them lightly into the dough.  This will help the herbs to adhere and not fall out of the dough when put through the pasta machine.  Top with the second sheet of dough.  Thin the sheet again between the rollers to 25 inches.  Cut five 5-inch squares from the dough and arrange them on a kitchen-towel-lined cookie sheet.

Continue with the rest of the dough.  As the strips are cut, layer them over more kitchen towels; do not put them directly on top of the first layer or they will stick together.

Fill a baking dish with cold water and add a few ice cubes.  Set aside.

Bring the 4 quarts water to a boil in a pasta pot without the insert.  Add the salt, then cook half a dozen strips at a time, about 1 minute; they will quickly rise to the surface.  Use a pasta scoop to lift the strips from the pot and transfer them to the dish with the ice water.  As soon as they are cool enough to handle, transfer the strips to clean kitchen towels and, with another towel, blot them dry.

Lightly butter two 13 1/2- by 9-inch baking dishes.  Set aside.

Spread about 1/4 cup of the filling along the length of each strip; roll them up into cylinders and place them seam side down in the baking dish.

At this point the cannelloni can be wrapped and refrigerated and cooked the following day or they can be sealed in aluminum foil and frozen for up to 3 months.  Frozen cannelloni do not need to be defrosted, but the baking time will be increased by 10 to 12 minutes.

To bake immediately, melt the butter and pour it evenly over the tops of the cannelloni.  Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top.  Cover the baking dishes with aluminum foil and bake the cannelloni for about 15 minutes.  Remove the dishes from the oven and turn on the broiler.  Remove the aluminum foil and broil the cannelloni just until the cheese begins to brown.  Remove and serve immediately, allowing two cannelloni per person as a first course.  Pass additional cheese for sprinkling on top.

Tip:  Use the small holes on a four-sided cheese grater to grate the vegetables or the grating disk in a food processor.

Tip:  Be sure the stems are completely detached from the parsley and basil or they will cause the dough to rip when it is thinned.

Note:  Nonfat ricotta cheese also works well, but increase the amount of salt by 1/2 teaspoon.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

<DirT>
Combine all the filling ingredients in a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide the pasta dough into quarters; work with one quarter at a time and keep the rest covered under a bowl on a lightly floured surface.  Knead the dough for a few minutes on a lightly floured work surface.  Flatten the dough with a rolling pin, then thin it in a hand-crank pasta machine to the thinnest setting.  Trim the thinned dough to 30 inches long and cut it in half.  Save any scraps for re-rolling.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly brush one half of the sheet with the beaten egg white.  Arrange a few leaves of parsley and basil along the length of the sheet, pressing them lightly into the dough.  This will help the herbs to adhere and not fall out of the dough when put through the pasta machine.  Top with the second sheet of dough.  Thin the sheet again between the rollers to 25 inches.  Cut five 5-inch squares from the dough and arrange them on a kitchen-towel-lined cookie sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Continue with the rest of the dough.  As the strips are cut, layer them over more kitchen towels; do not put them directly on top of the first layer or they will stick together.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Fill a baking dish with cold water and add a few ice cubes.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bring the 4 quarts water to a boil in a pasta pot without the insert.  Add the salt, then cook half a dozen strips at a time, about 1 minute; they will quickly rise to the surface.  Use a pasta scoop to lift the strips from the pot and transfer them to the dish with the ice water.  As soon as they are cool enough to handle, transfer the strips to clean kitchen towels and, with another towel, blot them dry.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly butter two 13 1/2- by 9-inch baking dishes.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Spread about 1/4 cup of the filling along the length of each strip; roll them up into cylinders and place them seam side down in the baking dish.
</DirT>
<DirT>
At this point the cannelloni can be wrapped and refrigerated and cooked the following day or they can be sealed in aluminum foil and frozen for up to 3 months.  Frozen cannelloni do not need to be defrosted, but the baking time will be increased by 10 to 12 minutes.
</DirT>
<DirT>
To bake immediately, melt the butter and pour it evenly over the tops of the cannelloni.  Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the top.  Cover the baking dishes with aluminum foil and bake the cannelloni for about 15 minutes.  Remove the dishes from the oven and turn on the broiler.  Remove the aluminum foil and broil the cannelloni just until the cheese begins to brown.  Remove and serve immediately, allowing two cannelloni per person as a first course.  Pass additional cheese for sprinkling on top.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  Use the small holes on a four-sided cheese grater to grate the vegetables or the grating disk in a food processor.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Tip:  Be sure the stems are completely detached from the parsley and basil or they will cause the dough to rip when it is thinned.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Note:  Nonfat ricotta cheese also works well, but increase the amount of salt by 1/2 teaspoon.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 10 servings.

                 Pasta 'Caramels' - {Caramelle Di Pasta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === DOUGH ===
  1              small  beet -- stem trimmed to 2"
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 3)
     1/2           cup  fine semolina flour
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  4              large  eggs
                        === FILLING ===
  3        tablespoons  butter
  3        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- minced
     1/3           cup  pine nuts
     1/2         pound  Gorgonzola cheese -- chopped
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2         pound  unsalted butter - (2 sticks) -- room temperature
  3                     garlic cloves -- peeled
  1 1/4           cups  flat-leaf parsley leaves - (packed)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 2)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Wrap the beet in foil and bake for 20 minutes, or until a fork pierces the flesh easily.  Let cool, then peel and puree in a food processor.  Set aside.

Meanwhile make the filling:  In a medium skillet, melt the butter.  Add the parsley and prosciutto and cook until the prosciutto begins to crisp.  Add the pine nuts and cook, stirring, until golden, about 3 minutes.  Remove the mixture to a bowl and add the cheese, mashing it with a fork until the mixture is smooth and well blended.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

To make the pasta, combine 2 cups of the unbleached flour, the semolina flour, and salt and mound on a work surface.  Make a well in the center of the flour and add the beet and eggs.  Mix the beet and eggs together with a fork until well blended, then gradually incorporate the flour from the inside walls of the well.  When the dough becomes too firm to mix with the fork, knead it with your hands until a ball of dough forms that is soft but no longer sticky.

Push aside the excess flour.  Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, adding additional flour as needed.  Cover the dough with a bowl and let rest for 10 minutes.

Divide the dough into 5 pieces.  Work with one piece at a time, keeping the rest covered.  Flatten each piece with a rolling pin, then roll the dough out through a pasta machine into 1/8-inch-thick strips 40 inches long and 4 inches wide.  Cut twenty 2-inch-wide strips from each piece.  Or roll the dough out by hand.

Spread a scant 1/2 teaspoon of the filling over each strip, leaving a 1/2-inch border all around.  Fold each strip lengthwise in half and pinch the edges to seal.  Twist the ends to resemble a candy wrapper.  Place the caramelle on clean kitchen towels in a single layer.

To make the sauce, place all the ingredients except the olive oil in a food processor or blender and pulse until blended.  With the motor running, drizzle in the olive oil.  Pulse until a smooth paste is obtained.  Transfer to a small saucepan and set aside until ready to use.  (The sauce can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 4 days.)

Bring 8 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Carefully add the caramelle and cook until al dente, about 4 minutes.  Carefully remove the caramelle with a slotted spoon and place them on a warm serving platter.

Meanwhile, heat the parsley sauce.  Pour the sauce over the caramelle, toss gently, and serve immediately.

To make ahead and freeze:  Place the caramelle in single layers on a floured cookie sheet between sheets of plastic wrap.  Cover with foil and freeze until hard.  Transfer to plastic bags, seal tightly, and freeze for up to 2 months.  Cook without thawing, until al dente, about 6 minutes.

This recipe makes about 10 dozen pasta twists, yields 12 servings.

Comments:  In addition to pasta all'uovo, pasta made from just eggs and unbleached flour, traditional pastas are also made from purees of fresh spinach, carrots, tomatoes, and beets.  In this unusual recipe, strips of beet pasta are twisted around a filling of Gorgonzola cheese, prosciutto, and pine nuts and transformed into caramelle, pasta resembling paper-wrapped candies.  Serve this as a first course.

       Pasta Fantasia With Fresh Cannellini Beans, Olive Sauce - .

                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Pappardelle noodles
     1/2           cup  dried cannellini beans -- soaked overnight
                        = (or Great White Northern beans)
                        === SAUCE ===
  20                    black oil cured olives -- pitted
  4              large  basil leaves
     1/2           cup  flat-leaf parsley
  1         tablespoon  pine nuts
  1              large  garlic clove
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of black pepper
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil

After rolling and cutting the dough into wide strips, use a knife and cut the strips crosswise into 1-inch pieces or into triangular pieces.  Place the pieces on lightly floured towels and allow them to dry for about 1 hour before cooking.  If you want to make and store the straccetti for future use, allow the pieces to dry until they are brittle, then store them in a sealed glass container and use up within 1 month.

Drain the water from the beans and put them in a small pot.  Cover the beans with 2 cups of fresh water and add 1 teaspoon of sea salt.  Cook until the skins easily slip off the beans.  Drain, then set aside and keep warm.

Mince the olives, basil leaves, parsley leaves, pine nuts, and garlic together on a cutting board.  Transfer the mixture to a large pasta bowl and set aside.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and stir in 1 tablespoon of sea salt.  Add the straccetti and cook just until al dente.  Drain off the water, reserving 2 tablespoons and transfer the straccetti and the reserved water to the bowl with the olive mixture.  Stir in the beans, salt, pepper and olive oil.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This dish is a fantasia, meaning that it is not a traditional Tuscan dish, but one that Iris created using the elements of Tuscan cooking, in this case, cannellini beans.  Iris makes pasta she calls straccetti with flour and eggs.  The name, which means tatters or rags, comes from cutting the dough into irregular pieces.  Use the recipe for Pappardelle to make the dough.  Or buy packaged pappardelle noodles and break them up into rough 1-inch pieces.

After rolling and cutting the dough into wide strips, use a knife and cut the strips crosswise into 1-inch pieces or into triangular pieces.  Place the pieces on lightly floured towels and allow them to dry for about 1 hour before cooking.  If you want to make and store the straccetti for future use, allow the pieces to dry until they are brittle, then store them in a sealed glass container and use up within 1 month.

                      Pasta Pizza - {Pizza Di Pasta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  2              large  garlic cloves -- peeled, and
                        cut in half lengthwise
  2               cans  minced clams - (10 oz ea) -- drained, and
                        liquid reserved
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  minced fresh Italian parsley leaves
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh basil leaves
  12            ounces  #31 rigatoni -- cooked according
                        to the package directions
  4                     anchovy fillets in oil -- drained, and
                        cut into bits
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or canned plum tomatoes - (3 or 4) -- diced
  8                     oil-cured black olives -- pitted and diced
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Brush a 14-inch pizza pan with a rim, a 15- by 11 1/2-inch baking sheet, or a 13 1/2- by 9-inch ovenproof casserole with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil.  Set aside.

In a saute pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and slowly cook the garlic in the oil over medium heat just until it starts to turn golden brown.  Remove and discard the garlic.  Add the clams and the reserved clam juice.  Cook for 2 minutes over medium-low heat.  Stir in the salt, pepper, parsley, and basil and cook slowly until the liquid is reduced by half.

Mix the cooked rigatoni with the clam mixture, then spread it evenly over the pizza pan, baking sheet, or casserole.  Sprinkle the anchovies over the pasta, then the tomatoes, olives, and oregano.  Drizzle the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil over the top.  Bake until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve at once.

Tip:  An olive pitter (lo snocciolive) makes quick work out of pitting olives and cherries.

Note:  Prepare this dish several hours ahead up to the baking point.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to bake.

Note:  If you prefer a "thicker" pizza, use a 12-inch round pan.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  How about a pizza di pasta?  This dish has all the components without the crust or the cheese!  Make this rigatoni and clam dish ahead of time for busy nights; it is easy to put together and can be baked on a pizza pan, cookie sheet, or in a casserole dish.  Some advice about clams -- cooking them over low heat will prevent them from becoming tough.

                   Patches And Peas - {Pezze E Piselli}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 1 3/4)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- thinly sliced
  4             ounces  prosciutto or pancetta -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  fresh or frozen and thawed peas
     1/2           cup  hot Homemade Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick) -- room temperature
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- plus
                        additional for serving

Mound the flour on a work surface and sprinkle on the salt.  Make a well in the center of the mound and crack the eggs into it.  Gently mix the eggs with a fork and start working in the flour from the inside of the well.  When the mixture is no longer easy to move with a fork, use your hands to work the ingredients into a smooth ball of dough.  You may not need all the flour.  Cover the dough with a bowl and let it rest for 10 minutes.

Divide the dough in half and work with 1 piece at a time.  Flatten the dough with a rolling pin and run it through a pasta machine set to the thinnest setting.  Cut the dough in half lengthwise with a pastry wheel or knife.  Then cut 2-inch squares or "patches" from each piece.  Repeat with the remaining dough.  Place the "squares" on a lightly floured cloth in a single layer.

In a skillet over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil and saute the onion slices until soft.  Add the prosciutto or pancetta, and saute for 3 or 4 minutes, or until it begins to brown.  Add the broth and peas.  Simmer the mixture for about 3 minutes, or until the peas are tender but not mushy.  Add salt and pepper and keep the mixture warm but uncovered.

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Add the patches and cook them until al dente.  Drain the patches in a colander, place them in a serving bowl with the butter and the cheese, and mix gently.  Add the pea mixture, combining the ingredients well.  Serve at once and pass additional cheese.

Note:  Instead of cutting square patches by hand, place each sheet of dough over the teeth of a ravioli form and roll over it with a rolling pin to form the pieces.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

         Penne With Butter And Truffle Paste - {Penne Al Coccio}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         ounce  dried porcini mushrooms
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/4         pound  thinly-sliced prosciutto -- minced
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1           teaspoon  black truffle paste
  1                cup  fresh peas
  1              pound  penne
  1                cup  heavy cream
  4             ounces  grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese

Put the mushrooms in a dish and cover them with warm water; allow them to plump up for 25 to 30 minutes.  Drain them, coarsely chop them and set aside.

Melt the butter over medium heat in a large earthenware, enameled cast-iron, or stainless steel saute pan.  Stir in the prosciutto and allow it to brown slightly.  Stir in the mushrooms, salt and pepper and allow the mixture to cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Stir in the truffle paste.  Cover the pan and keep it warm over low heat.

Cook the penne al dente in 4 quarts of boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Drain the penne and stir them into the sauce.  Over very low heat stir in the cream and half of the cheese.  The sauce should be creamy.  Serve the penne directly from the pan.  Pass the remaining cheese to sprinkle on top along with a grinding of black pepper.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Of the short cuts of pasta, penne is preferred in Tuscany and there are endless, and easy, preparations for sauces for them.  Penne al coccio is a favorite, usually made in some sort of cast-iron, stovetop-to-table pan.  I made this in Ralph Conte's seaside Tuscan villa kitchen and he loved it so much that he asked if it could be a special on his restaurant menu!  This is a very rich first course; the sauce is made from cream, butter and truffle paste, all the elements for a company dish.  Truffle paste is available in Italian specialty stores or online on the World Wide Web.

Stir in the mushrooms, salt and pepper and allow the mixture to cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Stir in the truffle paste.  Cover the pan and keep it warm over low heat.

<DirT>
Cook the penne al dente in 4 quarts of boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Drain the penne and stir them into the sauce.  Over very low heat stir in the cream and half of the cheese.  The sauce should be creamy.  Serve the penne directly from the pan.  Pass the remaining cheese to sprinkle on top along with a grinding of black pepper.

Comments:  Of the short cuts of pasta, penne is preferred in Tuscany and there are endless, and easy, preparations for sauces for them.  Penne al coccio is a favorite, usually made in some sort of cast-iron, stovetop-to-table pan.  I made this in Ralph Conte&apos;s seaside Tuscan villa kitchen and he loved it so much that he asked if it could be a special on his restaurant menu!  This is a very rich first course; the sauce is made from cream, butter and truffle paste, all the elements for a company dish.  Truffle paste is available in Italian specialty stores or online on the World Wide Web.

            Penne With Pistachios, Asparagus, And Cream - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  whole shelled natural pistachio nuts
  2               cups  water
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
  1              pound  thin asparagus -- washed, woody ends
                        removed, and stalks cut into thirds
     1/4           cup  unsalted butter - (1/2 stick)
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled, and
                        cut in half lengthwise
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
     1/3           cup  dry white wine
  1                cup  half-and-half
     1/4           cup  heavy cream
  1              pound  penne
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the nuts on an aluminum pie plate and toast them in the oven for 5 to 7 minutes, watching carefully so they do not burn.  Transfer the nuts to a cutting board, mince them, and set aside.

Bring the water to boil in a pot.  Add 1/2 half teaspoon of the salt and the asparagus.  Cook, uncovered, over medium-high heat just until a knife tip is easily inserted into the asparagus, about 3 minutes.  Drain and set aside.

In a saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the garlic and press on it with a wooden spoon to release its flavor.  When the garlic starts to brown around the edges, remove and discard it.  Add the asparagus and white pepper, raise the heat to high, and pour in the wine.  Stir the mixture carefully for about 1 minute.  Reduce the heat to medium.  Mix the half-and-half and heavy cream together and pour it over the asparagus mixture.  Cook for 2 minutes; the sauce should be thick and velvety like heavy cream.  Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.  Keep the mixture warm while the penne cooks.

Cook the penne according to the package directions.  Drain and return to the cooking pot.  Pour the asparagus sauce over the penne and stir carefully over low heat.  Add the cheese and continue to stir until the cheese melts.  Transfer the penne to a serving platter, sprinkle the nuts over the top, and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Perugia is a city of learning with its universities and the regional center of Umbria.  One reaches it by winding one's way up a hilltop where a breathtaking view of the Tiber valley awaits.  The Etruscan, medieval, Renaissance, and modern elements of the city all meld together to create a fascinating history of architecture.  The food is fascinating, too.  This is black truffle and spit-roasted porchetta (pork) country, and when it comes to pasta, the Umbrians combine it with what nature provides: An abundance of wild fennel and wild asparagus.  This dish made by master teacher Mario Ragni is one of my favorites.

               Pettole With Lamb And Champagne Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Lamb
                Main Dish                       Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  1              pound  lamb stew meat -- trimmed of fat,
                        and cut into bite-size pieces
  1                cup  dry champagne
  1                cup  hot homemade veal stock or beef broth
  5                     fresh or canned plum tomatoes -- peeled, seeded,
                        and coarsely chopped
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/4           cup  half-and-half
  8                     fresh basil leaves -- torn into small
                        pieces
  1              pound  homemade pettole
                        = (or store-bought pappardelle)

In a medium-size saute pan over medium-high heat, heat the olive oil, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, until it softens.  Add the lamb pieces and brown them.  Pour in 1/2 cup of the champagne, stir the mixture well for about 4 minutes, and allow the foam to subside.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and stir in the stock, tomatoes, salt, and pepper.  Cover the pan and let the sauce simmer until the meat is tender, 45 to 55 minutes.

Drain the meat in a mesh strainer set over a bowl to catch the liquid.  Set the meat aside in a separate bowl.  Return all but 1/4 cup of the liquid to the pan (there should be 2 cups of liquid) and stir in the remaining 1/2 cup champagne.  Cook, uncovered, over low heat until the mixture begins to simmer.

Whisk the flour into the reserved 1/4 cup liquid, then whisk it into the simmering sauce and cook until the mixture begins to thicken.  Whisk in the half-and-half and continue to cook for 2 minutes.  Turn off the heat, return the lamb to the pan, and stir in the basil.  Cover the sauce and keep warm while the pettole are cooking.

Cook the pettole according to the directions.  Drain them, reserving 2 tablespoons of the water, and return them to the pasta pot.  Stir in the sauce and the reserved cooking water.  Mix carefully, transfer the mixture to a deep platter, and serve immediately.

Variation:  This dish is equally as delicious with veal shoulder, trimmed from the bone and cut into pieces.

Note:  For even browning of the meat, wipe the pieces with paper towels so they are as dry as possible.

Note:  Save the veal shoulder bones to make Veal Stock.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Caserta, one of the provinces of the region of Campania, is home to my friend Mario Cipolla, a charming and engaging man who now helps his son, Mauro, run Caffe d'Arte, an espresso bar in Seattle.  Mario's grandmother Maria Grazia was a clever cook who used her wits to provide delicious meals.  One of Mario's favorite dishes from his grandmother's kitchen is a country-style pasta called pettole, for which there is a charming tale that goes like this: Beatrice, a beautiful peasant girl, went to a dance and saw and flirted with a noble-looking soldier, who asked for a turn on the dance floor.  The soldier whispered in her ear: "Beatrice, everyone says that you are a good cook, can you make me something wonderful to eat?"  So Beatrice invited him to her cottage, poor as it was, and scrubbed and cleaned all day in anticipation of his visit.  Then she began making dough from water, flour, and a drop of olive oil.  The soldier arrived carrying a bottle of expensive champagne and asked her what she was making to go with it.  "Pettole" she answered.  The soldier, realizing as he looked around that he was in humble surroundings, suggested that she add some champagne to the dough but she declined and added it instead to the meager lamb sauce she had made and in that instant elevated pettole into a dish fit for her noble soldier.  And, according to Mario, that is how pettole with a lamb and champagne sauce came to be the most asked for dish from his grandmother.  For this delicious adaptation, the sauce is thickened with half-and-half. Use homemade or store-bought pappardelle.

                                   Pici

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === PICI #1 ===
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- plus
                        additional if needed
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  warm filtered water
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === PICI #2 ===
  2 1/2           cups  finely-ground durum semolina flour -- plus
                        additional if needed
  1           teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  warm filtered water
  1           teaspoon  extra-virgin olive oil

Place the four and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade and whirl the mixture to blend.  With the motor running, slowly pour the water through the feed tube.  Add the olive oil and continue processing until a ball of dough is formed that is moist and holds together.  If the dough seems too dry, add a few drops of water and pulse.

Gather up the dough and knead it for a few minutes on a wooden surface, adding a little flour only if the dough is sticking to your hands.  Cover the dough with a bowl and let it rest for 30 minutes.

Divide the dough into quarters and work with one piece of dough at a time; keep the remaining pieces covered.

Flatten the dough slightly with a rolling pin, then thin it in a hand-crank pasta machine or us a rolling pin.  Do not make the dough too thin.  If using a pasta machine, thin the dough to the next to the last setting.

Cut the dough using the vermicelli or fettucine cutter.  the dough is very stretchy and resilient.  Place the pici on clean kitchen towels or, to dry for long-term storage, hang the pici over dowel rods.

Cut pici either 1/8- or 1/4-inch wide.

Note:  Both versions of pici can be made ahead, dried on dowel rods, and saved for future use.  Pici will keep for months in a cool place loosely covered with aluminum foil.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 pounds.

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     fennel bulb
  1              pound  carrots -- peeled, and
                        halved lengthwise
  6                     celery ribs -- trimmed
  1              bunch  scallions
  1                     red bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into chunks
  1                     yellow bell pepper -- cored, seeded,
                        and cut into chunks
  2                     tiny artichokes -- quartered (if
                        available)
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste

Remove the feathery leaves from the fennel and separate the bulb into pieces, leaving the stalks attached.

Arrange the vegetables in a deep salad bowl: Stand the fennel, carrots, celery, and scallions on end.  Place the pepper chunks and artichoke quarters, if using, in the center.

Pour the olive oil into a small serving bowl and add the salt and a dash of black pepper.

To eat, dip the vegetables in the olive oil.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Pinzimonio, as assortment of raw vegetables dipped in extra-virgin olive oil and eaten out of hand, can be served as antipasto or salad.  The colorful array usually includes fennel, tiny artichokes tender enough to eat raw, sweet peppers, carrots, celery, and scallions.  Leaving the vegetables in large pieces makes it easy to dip them in the olive oil.

                                 Polenta

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains
                Side Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  water
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1 1/2           cups  coarsely-ground cornmeal

In a large heavy pot, bring the water to a boil.  Add the salt.  Add the cornmeal in a thin stream, stirring vigorously all the while with a wooden spoon.  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until the mixture thickens and begins to leave the side of the pan, about 15 to 25 minutes, depending on the coarseness of the cornmeal.

Immediately pour the polenta onto a lightly oiled wooden board or platter.  Let it cool for 15 minutes, then cut into slices.  Serve with a sauce of your choice or in place of bread, noodles, or lasagna.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Polenta, or cornmeal cooked in milk or water, is to be found in the northern Italian regions of Lombardy, Piedmont, the Trentino, and Friuli-Venezia-Giulia.  Polenta requires constant vigorous stirring to achieve its characteristic smooth consistency.

                Polenta Sandwiches - {Polenta In Carrozza}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito

Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1             recipe  Polenta -- (see recipe),
                        chilled
     1/4         pound  prosciutto -- thinly sliced
     1/2         pound  Fontina cheese -- thinly sliced
  3              large  eggs
  1 1/2           cups  fresh bread crumbs
  5        tablespoons  butter

Cut the polenta into 12 slices.  Top 6 of the slices with the prosciutto and then the cheese.  Top each sandwich with another polenta slice.

In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs.  Spread the bread crumbs on a plate.  Dip both sides of each sandwich in the eggs and then dredge in the bread crumbs to coat both sides.  Set the sandwiches aside on a baking sheet to dry slightly.

In a frying pan, heat the butter.  Add the sandwiches and fry on both sides until golden brown and the cheese is melted.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Polenta is very versatile.  When it is cold, it can be sliced and layered into a type of lasagna or used like bread.  My favorite way to have it is as a sandwich, stuffed with cheese and ham and then fried in butter.  With a salad and a glass of wine, this makes a very satisfying meal.

                 Polenta With Cheese And Vegetables - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2           cups  zucchini in thin strips (matchsticks)
  1 1/2           cups  thinly-sliced mushrooms
  1             recipe  Polenta -- (see recipe),
                        chilled
  8                     thin slices Italian Fontina cheese - (1/2 

In a skillet, heat the oil.  Add the garlic and saute until soft.  Add the vegetables and saute until soft.  Cover to keep warm and set aside.

Cut the cold polenta into 8 slices and place them on a greased broiler pan.  Divide the vegetable mixture evenly among the slices, and top each slice with a slice of cheese.  Broil just until the cheese begins to melt.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Northern Italians are sometimes referred to as mangia polenta, mush eaters, because of the amount of cornmeal they eat.  There are many ways to prepare it and some Italians say polenta made with coarse-ground cornmeal is better than that from fine-ground.  Some prefer to use white cornmeal as opposed to yellow, as is the custom in Montalcino, Tuscany.  As a child, I did not like polenta, but Nonna Galasso made it every so often, even though she was a southern Italian.  Whenever she served it, I developed a stomachache that would quickly disappear when she offered me a pack of Lifesavers -- after I ate my polenta.

Comments:  Northern Italians are sometimes referred to as mangia polenta, mush eaters, because of the amount of cornmeal they eat.  There are many ways to prepare it and some Italians say polenta made with coarse-ground cornmeal is better than that from fine-ground.  Some prefer to use white cornmeal as opposed to yellow, as is the custom in Montalcino, Tuscany.  As a child, I did not like polenta, but Nonna Galasso made it every so often, even though she was a southern Italian.  Whenever she served it, I developed a stomachache that would quickly disappear when she offered me a pack of Lifesavers -- after I ate my polenta.

        Polenta With Dried Porcini - {Polenta Con Porcini Secchi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  dried porcini mushrooms - (abt 2 oz)
  6        tablespoons  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Polenta -- (see recipe),
                        chilled

In a small bowl, soak the porcini in water to cover for 1 hour.

Drain the porcini, reserving the soaking liquid, and cut into dice.  Strain the soaking liquid and set aside.

In a skillet, heat the olive oil.  Add the garlic and saute until soft.  Add the porcini and 1/4 cup of the reserved soaking liquid, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add salt and pepper.

Meanwhile, cut the cold polenta into 10 thick slices.  Place them on a lightly greased broiler pan or grill rack and broil or grill them until lightly browned.  Carefully transfer the slices to a serving platter, top with the porcini mixture, and serve.

This recipe yields 10 servings.

Comments:  A good polenta dish is enhanced by a balance of flavors.  By itself, polenta is rather bland, but when you match it with an ingredient with a definite flavor, like woodsy-tasting porcini, then you have a real culinary marriage.

       Polenta With Tomato Sauce - {Polenta Con Salsa Di Pomodoro}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- chopped
  3               cups  diced peeled fresh tomatoes
                        = (abt 6 medium tomatoes)
  2        tablespoons  dry red wine
  4        tablespoons  chopped fresh basil
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1             recipe  Polenta -- (see recipe),
                        chilled

In a saucepan, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil.  Add the garlic and saute until soft.  Add the tomatoes and red wine and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add the basil and salt and pepper and simmer for 5 minutes more.

Meanwhile, cut the polenta into 8 thick slices.  In a frying pan, heat the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil and fry the polenta slices on both sides until lightly browned.  Place the slices in individual soup bowls.

Pour the sauce over the polenta slices and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Polenta with tomato sauce is very common in the northern regions of Italy and can be likened to the southern favorite dish of pasta with tomato sauce.  Southern Italians also have their own version of polenta with tomato sauce, known as polentina; it is a little soupier than its northern cousin.

                   Potato Gnocchi - {Gnocchi Di Patate}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  baking potatoes
  1              large  egg -- beaten
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  3        tablespoons  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour -- more or less
  3               cups  Fresh Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Grated Pecorino-Romano cheese

Put the unpeeled potatoes in a large pot, add water to cover, and bring to a boil.  Boil until tender, about 30 minutes.  The potatoes can also be cooked in a microwave for 20 minutes.  Let cool.

Peel the potatoes.  In a large bowl mash them fine; do not use electric beaters or a food processor, which would make the potatoes too smooth.  Add the beaten egg, salt, and cheese.  Mix well.

Put 2 cups of flour on a work surface and make a well in the center.  Put the potatoes in the center of the well.  Knead the flour into the potatoes until a soft and smooth dough is formed.  Add a little more flour if the dough seems too sticky.

Break off a small piece of the dough about the size of an egg and, with floured hands, roll the chunk into a rope about 14 inches long and the width of your middle finger.  Cut the rope into 1-inch pieces and roll each piece with your thumb down and off the front of the tines of a floured fork: This creates little ridges to trap the sauce.  As you form the gnocchi, place them in a single layer on a floured cloth or baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough.

In a large pot of boiling water, cook the gnocchi, a few at a time, until they rise to the surface.  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the tomato sauce.  Spoon a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of a large serving platter.  Transfer the cooked gnocchi with a slotted spoon to the platter.  Spoon the remaining sauce over the gnocchi, sprinkle with grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and serve immediately.

Variation:  To make spinach gnocchi, add 1 cup cooked spinach, squeezed dry and chopped, to the potato and egg mixture; add the flour.  Then, instead of rolling the gnocchi on the tines of a fork, break off pieces of dough about the size of a marble and form them into small balls.  Cook as directed above and serve with the tomato sauce.

Note:  Uncooked gnocchi freeze well: Arrange them in a single layer on baking sheets, cover with foil, freeze until firm, and then transfer to plastic bags and freeze until needed.  Boil them without thawing.  My mother places frozen gnocchi directly into a baking dish, adds sauce, and bakes them, eliminating the boiling step: Bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  No one in my family makes gnocchi as well as Aunt Nancy Scatorchie.  She can roll them off the tines of a fork with lightning speed.  Perfect gnocchi depends on the use of mature potatoes and a minimal amount of flour; otherwise they will be too heavy.  There are many variations of gnocchi; these little dumplings are covered with a zippy tomato sauce, dusted with Pecorino Romano cheese, and sprinkled with fresh basil.

                Potato Gnocchi With Gorgonzola Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  potatoes
  2               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
  2        tablespoons  minced fresh Italian parsley
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/2         pound  Gorgonzola cheese
  1                cup  heavy cream
  2        tablespoons  tomato sauce

Boil, bake, or microwave the potatoes until tender.  Cool and peel them, then place in a large bowl.  Mash the potatoes with a hand masher.  You should have about 4 cups of mashed potatoes.  Add the flour, egg, parsley, nutmeg, salt, and 1/4 cup grated cheese.  Mix well with your hands.  If the mixture seems too sticky, add up to 1/2 cup more flour.  To test for the right amount of flour, make a few gnocchi and drop them into a pot of boiling water.  If they rise to the surface and hold their shape without disintegrating, the proportion of flour to potato is correct.

Divide the dough into 6 pieces.  Work with 1 piece at a time on a floured surface and roll it into a rope about 30 inches long and the width of your middle finger.  Cut the rope with a knife into 1-inch pieces.  Roll each piece on the tines of a fork and place the gnocchi on a floured baking sheet in a single layer.  Continue until all the dough is used.

For the sauce, cut the Gorgonzola in chunks and place in a saucepan with the cream and tomato sauce.  Heat the mixture over medium-high heat until the cheese is melted.  Keep warm.

In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Gently add the gnocchi and cook just until they bob to the surface.  Drain them with a slotted spoon, place in a serving dish, and toss with half the sauce.  Add the remaining sauce, sprinkle on the remaining 1/4 cup of grated cheese, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  There are many variations on gnocchi, or dumplings.  Some are made with potatoes, others with a combination of spinach and potatoes, and still others like those of Sardinia use saffron in the dough.  There are also gnocchi made from semolina flour, which is light and delicate.  This recipe comes from my Italian friend Maria Castaldo, a southern Italian who doesn't top these potato gnocchi with the traditional tomato sauce; rather, she uses a Gorgonzola cheese sauce, something more common in the north of Italy.  The trick to making potato gnocchi is to add just the minimum amount of flour to the potatoes -- otherwise the gnocchi will be too heavy.  I always weigh my flour when making these dumplings.  Two cups of lightly spooned flour, or 8 ounces, seems to work well.

Add the flour, egg, parsley, nutmeg, salt, and 1/4 cup grated cheese.  Mix well with your hands.  If the mixture seems too sticky, add up to 1/2 cup more flour.  To test for the right amount of flour, make a few gnocchi and drop them into a pot of boiling water.  If they rise to the surface and hold their shape without disintegrating, the proportion of flour to potato is correct.

Divide the dough into 6 pieces.  Work with 1 piece at a time on a floured surface and roll it into a rope about 30 inches long and the width of your middle finger.  Cut the rope with a knife into 1-inch pieces.  Roll each piece on the tines of a fork and place the gnocchi on a floured baking sheet in a single layer.  Continue until all the dough is used.

For the sauce, cut the Gorgonzola in chunks and place in a saucepan with the cream and tomato sauce.  Heat the mixture over medium-high heat until the cheese is melted.  Keep warm.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a boil.  Gently add the gnocchi and cook just until they bob to the surface.  Drain them with a slotted spoon, place in a serving dish, and toss with half the sauce.  Add the remaining sauce, sprinkle on the remaining 1/4 cup of grated cheese, and serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  There are many variations on gnocchi, or dumplings.  Some are made with potatoes, others with a combination of spinach and potatoes, and still others like those of Sardinia use saffron in the dough.  There are also gnocchi made from semolina flour, which is light and delicate.  This recipe comes from my Italian friend Maria Castaldo, a southern Italian who doesn&apos;t top these potato gnocchi with the traditional tomato sauce; rather, she uses a Gorgonzola cheese sauce, something more common in the north of Italy.  The trick to making potato gnocchi is to add just the minimum amount of flour to the potatoes -- otherwise the gnocchi will be too heavy.  I always weigh my flour when making these dumplings.  Two cups of lightly spooned flour, or 8 ounces, seems to work well.

              Potato Gnocchi With Pecorino Cream Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                cup  young Pecorino cheese -- cut small pieces
     2/3           cup  heavy cream
                        Grinding of black pepper
                        === DOUGH ===
  6              large  Yukon Gold potatoes -- scrubbed
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt - (to 1 1/2)
                        Semolina flour -- as needed
                        Potato starch -- as needed

Put the cheese and cream in a small saucepan and heat it until the cheese melts.  Mix the sauce so it is smooth; cover it, set it aside and keep it warm while making the gnocchi.

Put the potatoes in a large pot and cover them with cold water.  Bring them to a boil and cook them until they are fork tender.  Drain and cool the potatoes, then peel them.

Rice the potatoes into a large bowl or mash them using a hand masher.  Stir in the salt to taste.

Lightly spread a work surface with a thin layer of semolina flour.  Divide the potato mixture into 4 sections and work with one at a time.  Roll the potatoes under the palm of your hand on the floured surface to form a long rope about the thickness of your middle finger.  Cut one small piece and drop it into a small pan of boiling water to see if it will hold together without breaking up in the water.  If it holds together, cut the remaining rope into 1-inch pieces and place them in single layers on floured towels.  If the dough does not hold together, remix all the potatoes with a little bit of potato starch, using 1 tablespoon at a time and testing as above until the gnocchi hold together.

Continue making more gnocchi until all the dough is used.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon of salt.  Gently lift the towels with the gnocchi and shake them into the boiling water.  They will not take long to cook, only a minute, or until they bob to the top.

Remove them with a slotted strainer, making sure to shake off the excess water and place them on a platter.

Pour the warm sauce over the top and give the gnocchi a grinding of pepper.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

Comments:  Damiano loves to mix and match the traditional dishes of Italy and his potato gnocchi with a Pecorino cheese sauce is a perfect example.  He uses only two ingredients, potatoes and a hint of flour and his fingers tell him when the dough is just right.  Creating the dough "off the cuff" can be a daunting proposition for some cooks, especially in the gnocchi department, when so many are terrified of making lead sinkers instead of fluffy dumplings.  The best advice I can give is to go by feel, and trial and error.  There are many versions of gnocchi, but potato is the most popular and is usually topped with a fresh tomato sauce but here again Damiano shows his ingenuity by making a quick sauce from Pecorino cheese and cream.

        Pumpkin Gnocchi, My Way - {Gnocchi Di Zucca Alla Moda Mia}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 16    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  butternut squash
  1              large  egg
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/3           cup  finely-crushed amaretti cookies -- (abt 6 cookies)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  2               cups  unbleached flour - (to 2 1/2)
                        === SAUCE ===
  12       tablespoons  butter - (1 1/2 sticks)
  3              large  fresh rosemary sprigs

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

Cut the squash in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds and stringy membrane, and discard.  Place the squash cut-side down in a baking dish and add about 1/2 cup water.  Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake until the squash is tender, about 30 to 35 minutes.

Remove the squash from the oven and let cool completely.  Scoop the flesh from the squash halves and place in a small sieve over a bowl.  Press on the squash with a spoon to remove as much water as possible.  There should be about 1 1/4 cups well-drained squash.  Place the squash in a bowl and add the egg, cheese, amaretti, and nutmeg.  Mix well to combine.

On a work surface, place 2 cups of flour in a mound and make a well or hole in the center.  Scoop the squash mixture into the well and gradually begin adding the flour into the squash until you have a ball of dough.  If you need more flour, add it a little at a time.  This is a soft dough and too much flour will yield a heavy dumpling.  To test for the right amount of flour, form a dumpling by pinching off a 1-inch piece, rolling it gently into an oblong shape, and placing it in a small pot of boiling water.  If it holds together and does not disintegrate in the water, the flour-egg ratio is fine.  If it falls apart, add more flour.

On a well-floured surface and with well-floured hands, knead the dough gently until it is smooth.  Roll it into an 8-inch log.  Cut the log into 4 equal pieces.  Working with 1 piece at a time, roll each piece into a 20-inch-long rope about 1-inch wide.  Cut each rope into forty 1/2-inch pieces and press each piece gently against the tines of a fork, or roll between the palms of your hand into a 1-inch long oblong.  Place the pieces on a floured towel.  Let the gnocchi rest 15 minutes.

In a skillet, melt the butter, add the rosemary sprigs, and swirl them in the butter for several minutes to infuse the butter with their flavor.  Remove the sprigs and discard.  Keep the sauce covered and warm.

In 6 quarts of boiling water, cook the gnocchi until they rise to the surface, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain carefully using a serrated spoon.  Place the gnocchi in a serving platter and pour the butter sauce over them.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields about 160 gnocchi for 16 servings.

Comments:  The Gastronomical Guide of Italy lists over a dozen ways to prepare gnocchi, which does not surprise me.  I have experimented with many ways to make these delicate dumplings, including this one for Pumpkin Gnocchi, a northern Italian specialty.  Italian pumpkins tend to be sweeter than ours, so I have substituted butternut squash.  These make a delightful first course for a fall dinner.

The dough is rather soft, but produces a very light gnocco.  Be careful not to add more flour than needed.  How much to add will depend on the wetness of the squash, the size of your egg, the flour used, and the humidity in the air.  The recipe was tested in my kitchen on a wintery Saturday morning and used the amount of flour listed, but it is only a guide.  Like potato gnocchi, these can be rolled off the tines of a fork at lightning speed, or fashioned delicately between the palms of your hands.  They have a slightly sweet flavor that complements the rosemary sauce.

                   Pumpkin Risotto - {Risotto Di Zucca}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              small  pie pumpkin - (abt 1/2 lbs)
  6        tablespoons  butter
  1              large  leek, white part only -- halved lengthwise,
                        well rinsed, and diced
  1                cup  Arborio rice
  3 1/2           cups  hot Homemade Chicken Broth -- (see recipe)
  1                cup  dry white wine
     1/4           cup  mascarpone cheese
     1/3           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Cut off the pumpkin stem.  With a vegetable peeler, remove the skin.  Cut the pumpkin in half, and remove and discard the seeds and stringy flesh.  Dice enough of the pumpkin to make 1 cup.  (Save any remaining pumpkin for another use.)

In a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter.  Add the pumpkin and leek and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until softened.  Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter.  Cook, stirring, until the rice begins to crackle, about 5 minutes; do not let brown.  Slowly add 1/2 cup of the chicken broth and stir constantly until the rice absorbs all the liquid.  Add a little of the wine and continue stirring until it is absorbed.  Continue  adding broth and wine alternately, stirring all the while, until the rice is al dente, with a creamy consistency.

Stir in the cheeses, blending well and stirring until the mascarpone melts.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  Classic risotto usually gets its deep golden hue from saffron, but in this version from Terry Rozzi, whose home is Cremona, in northern Italy, diced pumpkin provides not only a delicate color but also a slightly sweet taste.  Part of the process can be started in advance, by cooking the leeks, pumpkin, and rice in the butter; set aside at room temperature, or refrigerate if more than a few hours before serving time.

Part of the process can be started in advance, by cooking the leeks, pumpkin, and rice in the butter; set aside at room temperature, or refrigerate if more than a few hours before serving time.

                    Raffaella's Pumpkin Tortelli - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  butternut squash or pumpkin
     1/4           cup  crushed amaretti cookies
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  4          teaspoons  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
                        === PASTA ===
  4              large  eggs
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  salt

To make the filling, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut the squash or pumpkin in half, scoop out the seeds, and discard.  Place the halves cut-side down in a small baking dish, add 1/2 cup water, and cover the dish with foil.  Bake for 35 minutes, or until the squash is easily pierced with a fork.  Let cool.  With a spoon, scoop out the flesh of the squash.  Put it in a colander and let it drain for 45 minutes.

Transfer the squash to a bowl and mash it well.  Add the amaretti, nutmeg, salt, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and mix well.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

To make the pasta, combine the flour with the salt and mound it on a work surface.  Make a well in the center of the flour and break the eggs into the well.  Beat the eggs with a fork.  Then, using the fork, gradually incorporate the flour from the inside walls of the well.  When the dough becomes too firm to mix with the fork, knead it with your hands, incorporating just enough of the flour to make a soft but not sticky dough.  You may not need all the flour.  Brush the excess flour aside and knead the dough, adding additional flour as necessary, for about 10 minutes, or until smooth.  Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.

Knead the dough well and cut it into 4 pieces.  Work with 1 piece at a time, keeping the rest covered.  Roll each piece out to the thinnest setting on a pasta machine, or roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch.

Cut 4- by 2 1/2-inch rectangles from the sheets of dough.  Place 1 teaspoon of the filling in the center of each rectangle, fold the rectangles in half lengthwise, making sure to pinch the edges well to seal in the filling, and place on a floured towel.  Gather the dough scraps into a ball and reroll them to make more tortelli (You can also make round, half-moon, or square-shaped tortelli.)

To cook, bring a large pot or water to a boil.  Cook the tortelli, about 2 dozen at a time, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they rise to the surface.  Drain them carefully, sauce, and serve.  Raffaella's mother serves these tossed with a generous amount of melted butter and sprinkled with grated Parmigiano.  They are also good with sage butter -- add a small handful of fresh sage leaves to the melted butter and press them into the butter with a wooden spoon to release their flavor.

To freeze, arrange the tortelli in a single layer on floured baking sheets, cover with foil, and freeze until hard.  Transfer them to plastic bags and freeze for up to 3 months.  Do not defrost them before boiling (they will take a little longer to cook).

This recipe yields about 100 tortelli.

Comments:  A few years ago I had the good fortune to meet a group of Italian students who were visiting the States.  Among them was Raffaella Neviani, a vivacious young woman from Cavriago, in the north of Italy.  When she left to return home, I helped her load her belongings on the bus for the long ride to the airport.  Hugging me goodbye, she slipped into my hand her mother's heirloom recipe for pumpkin-filled tortelli, a specialty of Reggio-Emilia.  These rectangular ravioli are fun to make and the crushed amaretti cookies in the filling are a subtle but delicious addition.  This recipe makes a lot, so you can freeze some for later use.

            Ravioli Stuffed With Red Peppers And Ricotta - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  2             medium  red bell peppers
  2 2/3           cups  ricotta cheese -- well drained
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  1                     extra-large egg
  3        tablespoons  minced flat-leaf parsley
     1/2      teaspoon  fine sea salt
                        === DOUGH ===
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  4                     extra-large eggs
                        === SAUCE ===
  14       tablespoons  unsalted butter -(1 3/4 sticks) -- melted, kept warm
                        Freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for sprinkling

Preheat the broiler.  Place the peppers on a broiler pan and broil, turning, until blackened on all sides.  Let cool.  Peel, core, and seed the peppers and dice them.  Place in a bowl, add the ricotta cheese, Parmigiano cheese, egg, parsley, and salt, and mix well.  Refrigerate until ready to use.

Mound the flour on a work surface and sprinkle on the salt.  Make a well in the center of the flour and add the eggs.  With a fork, gently beat the eggs, then gradually incorporate the flour from the inside of the well.  When the dough becomes too firm to mix with the fork, use your hands to knead it into a ball of dough that is soft but no longer sticky, adding more flour as necessary.

Push the excess flour aside and knead the dough for about 5 minutes.  Cover the dough with a bowl and let rest for 10 minutes.

Divide the dough into 4 pieces.  To make the ravioli using a ravioli form, flatten each piece of dough slightly with a rolling pin and run it through the rollers of a pasta machine on the thinnest setting.  Cut the dough into 13-inch lengths.  Place one sheet of dough over the bottom part of a ravioli form, making sure that the sheet overhangs the sides slightly.  Use the top part of the form to make slight impressions in the dough.  Place about one teaspoon of the filling in each impression.  Cover with a second sheet of dough and carefully roll over the form with a rolling pin to create the ravioli.  Gently push the ravioli out onto a clean towel and arrange in a single layer.  Continue with the remaining dough and filling.

To make the ravioli by hand, roll out each piece into a 16- by 14-inch rectangle.  Space teaspoons of the filling about 1 1/2 inches apart on one sheet.  Cover with another sheet of dough.  Press down around the mounds of filling with your fingers to seal, and cut into ravioli with a ravioli wheel.

Bring 8 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.  Add half the ravioli and cook just until they float to the top, about 1 minute.  Scoop the ravioli out of the water with a strainer and place on a platter and drizzle with a little of the melted butter.  Toss gently.  Top with the remaining butter and a sprinkling of cheese.  Serve immediately.

To freeze the uncooked ravioli, place them in single layers on floured cookie sheets.  Cover with aluminum foil and freeze until firm, about 1 hour.  Transfer to plastic bags and freeze.  Do not defrost before cooking.

This recipe yields about 8 dozen ravioli, 10 to 12 servings.  Makes about 2/3 cup sauce, enough to dress 4 dozen ravioli.

Comments:  Here is my version of a wonderful dish of delicate ravioli with a roasted pepper and cheese filling, which I serve as a first course on Christmas Day.

                      Raw Fava Bean Spread - {Maccu}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Dips/Spreads
                Italian

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3             pounds  fresh fava beans -- shelled
                        = (abt 3 cups shelled if small, or 1 3/4
                        cups if need to peel outer shell)
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil - (to 1/2)
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino cheese
                        Grinding of black pepper
  12             small  bread slices -- toasted

In a food processor, grind the fava beans to a pulp with the garlic cloves.  Slowly pour enough olive oil through the feed tube with the motor running until a smooth but not too runny paste forms.  The fava beans should have the consistency of mashed potatoes.

Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the cheese.  Spread a small amount on the bread slices and drizzle each one with a little extra-virgin olive oil.  Extra paste can be stored in a jar in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  Serve the toasts immediately.

Note:  Did you know that fava beans love to grow in cool weather and will germinate in soil as cold as 40 degrees?

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  In Sicilian dialect the word is maccu.  In Ligurian dialect the word is marro, but no matter what the dialect word is, this spreadable paste made from fresh fava beans is delicious.  It is best to use young fava beans since they will be much creamier than older and bigger beans.  If larger beans are the only kind available, they will need to be cooked first in boiling water before proceeding with the recipe.  Boil until the outer skin of the bean easily slips off, and the beans are soft enough to be mashed between the fingers.  Fava beans are also available frozen.

               Red Pepper Sauce - {Salsa Di Peperoni Rossi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4              large  red bell peppers
  4        tablespoons  butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1                cup  heavy cream or half-and-half
  1           teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated black pepper
     1/4           cup  minced fresh basil or thyme

Place the peppers on a lightly greased broiler pan and broil, turning occasionally, until blackened all over, about 15 minutes.  Place the peppers in a large paper bag, close the bag tightly, and let cool for 20 minutes.

Peel the peppers and remove the seeds and cores.  Rinse the peppers well, place them in a food processor or blender, and puree until smooth.  Set aside.

In a large frying pan, heat the butter and sauté the garlic over medium heat until soft.  Add the pepper puree and mix well.  Lower the heat and gradually stir in the heavy cream.  Add the nutmeg, salt, and pepper and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in the basil or thyme.  Serve immediately over hot pasta or refrigerate for up to 3 days.

This recipe yields about 3 1/2 cups.

Comments:  Peperoni means "peppers", not the dried sausage used on pizza.  Peppers are everywhere in Italian cuisine: Stuffed, fried, baked, marinated, and eaten raw.  I like to make a sauce out of red bell peppers and cream that is wonderful on pasta and fish.  Try it on Ravioli con Aragosta.

                       Rice Cake - {Torta Di Riso}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  butter
     1/4           cup  fine bread crumbs -- toasted
     1/4           cup  raisins
  2        tablespoons  sweet Marsala wine
  2               cups  milk
  2               cups  water
     1/2           cup  sugar
                        Grated zest of 1 lemon
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1                cup  arborio rice
  2              large  eggs -- separated
  1         tablespoon  vanilla extract
     1/4           cup  diced candied citron

Grease a 6-cup glass or ceramic mold with 1 tablespoon of the butter.  Coat the mold with the bread crumbs, shaking out the excess.  Refrigerate until ready to fill.

In a small bowl, soak the raisins in the Marsala for 30 minutes.

In a 1 1/2-quart saucepan, combine the milk, water, sugar, lemon zest, and salt.  Bring the mixture to a boil, add the rice, and cook slowly until all the liquid is absorbed, about 12 to 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Transfer the rice to a bowl and cool to warm, then mix in the egg yolks, vanilla, remaining butter, citron, and raisins with Marsala.

In a separate bowl, with an electric beater, beat the egg whites until stiff.  Fold the egg whites into the rice mixture.  Spread the rice evenly in the prepared mold and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the middle comes out clean.

Let the mold cool completely.  Place a serving plate larger than the mold on top, invert, and release onto the plate.  Cut into wedges to serve.

This recipe yields 8 servings.

Comments:  A dessert made for special occasions like Easter was this Torta di Riso, or Rice Cake.  There are many versions of this cake in Italy, but this remains my favorite.  If you cannot find citron, substitute candied fruit peel.

                     Rice Gnocchi - {Gnocchi Di Riso}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6               cups  water
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1 1/2           cups  Arborio rice
     1/4           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- plus
  1           teaspoon  unsalted butter -- room temperature
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
     2/3           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2                     eggs
                        Flour -- as needed
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste

Bring the water to a boil in a 4-quart, non-stick saucepan, add the salt, and stir in the rice.  Cook the rice, uncovered, over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the rice absorbs most of the water.  This will take about 20 minutes.  Transfer the rice to a bowl and let it come to room temperature, or refrigerate it for several hours to make it easier to shape into balls.  Stir in the bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons of the butter, the nutmeg, 1/3 cup of the cheese, and the eggs.

Grease a baking dish with 1 teaspoon of the butter and set it aside.

With your hands, form balls the size of a small lemon.  Roll each ball in flour and place them in the baking pan.  Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter and pour it over the gnocchi.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top and season with more salt to taste.  At this point the dish can be covered and refrigerated and baked the next day.

When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Bake the gnocchi until they are nicely browned, about 35 minutes.  Serve immediately.

Did you know that there is no such thing as salted butter in Italy?  All butter is unsalted.  If you are using salted butter in the recipe, adjust the amount of salt called for to taste.

This recipe yields about 1 1/2 dozen.

Comments:  The idea of making gnocchi conjures up fear in some people.  Most have eaten potato gnocchi, small bits of a flour and potato dough that is rolled off the tines of a fork, but they are hesitant to make them for fear the dough will be too tough.  In our series I have introduced many types of gnocchi, including those made with spinach, pumpkin, and ricotta cheese.  This Emilian version of rice gnocchi is not as well known.  It is made with Arborio rice, the same short-grain, starchy rice used to make risotto.  This recipe will work with leftover Arborio rice as well.  The gnocchi can be made and refrigerated for a day before baking.

                Rice Milan Style - {Risotto Alla Milanese}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  saffron threads
  2        tablespoons  warm water
  4 1/2           cups  Homemade Chicken Broth - (to 5) -- see recipe
  6        tablespoons  butter
     1/2           cup  finely-minced white onion
  2               cups  Arborio rice
  1                cup  dry white wine
     3/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Put the saffron threads in a small bowl and add the warm water.  Set aside to soak.

In a saucepan, bring the chicken broth just to a simmer.  Keep warm over low heat.

In a large heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.  Add the onion and saute until very soft; do not allow to brown -- it should remain colorless and almost seem to dissolve in the butter.  Add the rice and cook 1 to 2 minutes, stirring to coat each grain with the butter-onion mixture.

When the rice begins to make a crackling sound, reduce the heat to medium-low and add 1/2 cup of the white wine.  Cook, stirring constantly, until all the wine is absorbed.  Add 1/2 cup of the hot chicken broth and cook, continuing to stir, until the rice has absorbed the liquid.  Add the remaining 1/2 cup wine and then add 4 cups of the broth 1/2 cup at a time, continuing to stir and allowing the rice to absorb each addition of liquid.  Test the rice for doneness: It should be just al dente, not at all mushy, and hold its shape.  If necessary, add up to 1/2 cup more broth and cook, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente.  Add the saffron threads with the water and mix well.

Remove the rice from the heat and stir in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Serve at once.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  One of the traditional rice dishes of northern Italy is risotto, made with a starchy rice.  The little pearls are first quickly sauteed in butter, and then liquid is added to finish the cooking process and plump up the grains of rice.  The Venetians like to say the rice should be all'onda, or on the wave crest.  That is, the rice should not be lumpy, but wavy and creamy and flow easily off the spoon.  There are many variations of the classic risotto alla Milanese; this one is my favorite.  The saffron gives a subtle flavor, and a yellowish hue, to the rice.

Comments:  One of the traditional rice dishes of northern Italy is risotto, made with a starchy rice.  The little pearls are first quickly sauteed in butter, and then liquid is added to finish the cooking process and plump up the grains of rice.  The Venetians like to say the rice should be all&apos;onda, or on the wave crest.  That is, the rice should not be lumpy, but wavy and creamy and flow easily off the spoon.  There are many variations of the classic risotto alla Milanese; this one is my favorite.  The saffron gives a subtle flavor, and a yellowish hue, to the rice.

                 Ricotta Dumplings - {Gnocchi Di Ricotta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  ricotta cheese -- well drained
  1                cup  cooked spinach - (packed) -- well squeezed,
                        and chopped
     1/4           cup  diced Fontina cheese
     1/4           cup  diced Swiss cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/4           cup  toasted fresh bread crumbs -- plus
  2        tablespoons  toasted fresh bread crumbs
  2        tablespoons  butter - (1/4 stick) -- softened
  2              large  egg yolks -- beaten
                        Salt -- to taste
  1           teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
  1 1/2           cups  tomato sauce

In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients except the tomato sauce.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Using 2 soup spoons, form gnocchi into oval or egg shapes using a little less than 1/4 cup of the mixture for each.  There should be about twenty 2 1/2-inch-long gnocchi.  Place them close together, but not touching, in a buttered 13 1/2- by 8-inch baking dish.  Cover the gnocchi with the tomato sauce and bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until hot.  Serve immediately.

Note:  Sometimes a white sauce is used in addition to the tomato sauce.  Spread the baking dish with the white sauce before adding the gnocchi.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  These are gnocchi as made in the Marches.  Unlike potato gnocchi, which are shaped on the tines of a fork and boiled, these are shaped into ovals or eggs using two soup spoons and then baked.  They are light and delicious.  Chill the mixture first for easier forming.

         Rigatoni With Capri Sauce - {Rigatoni Con Salsa Caprese}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1              large  garlic clove -- minced
  4               cups  diced plum tomatoes
  2          teaspoons  fine sea salt
                        Grinding of fresh black pepper
     1/3           cup  dry red wine
  2        tablespoons  sugar
     1/2           cup  fresh basil leaves -- shredded
  1              pound  store-bought rigatoni
  8              ounce  ball fresh mozzarella cheese -- diced
  1                cup  finely-chopped well-drained cooked spinach

Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a 4-quart saucepan.  Cook the onion, stirring, until it becomes soft, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, until the garlic is soft but still white.  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, pepper, wine, and sugar.  Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook the sauce for 20 minutes.  The sauce should still be loose, but not thin.  Stir in the basil leaves.  Set the sauce aside and keep warm.

Meanwhile, cook the rigatoni according to the package instructions.  When al dente, drain the rigatoni, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Return the rigatoni to the pot and, over low heat, stir in the reserved water, 1 cup of the tomato sauce, the cheese, and spinach.  Stir until the cheese melts.

Transfer the mixture to a shallow platter.  Serve at once, passing additional sauce on the side.  Save the remaining tomato sauce for other uses such as on pizza or in stews.  Or freeze it for future use.

This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings.

Comments:  Rigatoni teams with this easy sauce I call salsa caprese because it uses the very ingredients  that make up the more popular insalata caprese, a salad of fresh creamy mozzarella cheese, pungent and peppery basil leaves, and fresh plum tomatoes popular on the isle of Capri.  In a pinch, canned plum tomatoes can be used.

       Rigatoni With Onion Sauce - {Rigatoni Con Salsa Di Cipolla}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  rigatoni
                        = (or other short-cut pasta)
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter -- softened
     1/4         pound  lean salt pork -- finely diced
  1              large  onion -- peeled, and
                        thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  unbleached all-purpose flour
  1                cup  hot beef broth - (to 1 1/2)
                        = (homemade or canned low-sodium)
     1/4           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- plus
  2        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  2          teaspoons  coarsely-ground black pepper

In a pasta pot with an insert, cook the rigatoni until it is al dente, according to the directions.  Drain the rigatoni, transfer to a bowl, and coat them with the butter.  Set aside.

In a large saute pan over medium heat, cook the salt pork and onion together until the salt pork is browned and has rendered its fat.  Sprinkle the flour over the salt pork and onion and stir to blend.  Stir in the rigatoni.  Pour in half of the beef broth, stirring.  Add the cheese and remaining broth, stirring well.  Remove from the heat, stir in the pepper, transfer the rigatoni and sauce to a pasta platter or bowl, and serve at once.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This delicious onion sauce was served to me by my friend Mario Rogni, who lives in Perugia in the region of Umbria.  What made the sauce so memorable was Mario's homemade lard, but I have substituted salt pork with good results.  Use a rigatoni or ziti cut of pasta for this dish, which is cooked ahead of time, then added to the sauce and cooked briefly again as the sauce thickens.

                   Roasted Tomato And Leek Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/2         pounds  fresh plum tomatoes -- washed, cored,
                        and left whole
  1              large  leek (6 oz), white part only -- cut lengthwise,
                        washed well, and cut into quarters
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt
  2          teaspoons  dried oregano
  1         tablespoon  balsamic vinegar
  1         tablespoon  sugar

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Place the whole tomatoes and the leek (cut-side down) on a nonstick baking sheet.  Roast the vegetables until the tomatoes are soft to the touch and the leek has begun to brown, 30 to 35 minutes.  Transfer the vegetables to a food processor and process until a thick, chunky sauce is obtained.

To make a smooth sauce, transfer the pureed vegetables to a fine mesh colander placed over a bowl.  Press on the ingredients with a wooden spoon to squeeze the sauce through the colander.  Discard the solids.

Transfer the sauce to a large nonreactive bowl and stir in the salt, oregano, vinegar, and sugar.  The sauce is ready to use, or freeze for future use.

This recipe yields 1 1/2 cups smooth or 2 1/4 cups chunky.

Comments:  I often surprise myself by taking little detours with cooking techniques and traditions.  Such is the case with this roasted no-fat tomato-and-leek sauce.  The sauce can be smooth or chunky and dress fresh, filled, or plain pasta.  A favorite combination with the smooth version of this sauce is spaghetti with sugar snap peas and Sardinian feta cheese.  Use the chunky version with rigatoni or with orecchiette.

                 Saffron Gnocchi - {Gnocchi Al Zafferano}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/8      teaspoon  powdered saffron
  1                cup  very warm water
  1              large  egg
  2 1/4           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour - (to 2 1/2)
     2/3           cup  semolina flour
  1         tablespoon  salt -- plus
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  2 1/2           cups  tomato sauce -- heated

In a large bowl, dissolve the saffron in the water.  Add the egg and beat well with a fork.

In a separate bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups of the all-purpose flour with the semolina and 1/8 teaspoon salt.  Add the flour mixture to the saffron and water, and mix with your hands until a ball of dough begins to form.  Gradually add enough of the remaining flour to form a soft, but not sticky ball of dough.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it until smooth.  Let the dough rest, covered for 10 minutes.

Knead the dough again on a floured surface until smooth and elastic.  Cut the dough into 6 pieces and cover.  Roll 1 piece at a time into a 21- or 22-inch-long rope, 3/4-inch wide.  Cut the rope into 1/2-inch pieces and press each piece against the times of a fork or clean comb to create lines.  Place the gnocchi on lightly floured trays or clean towels.

In a large pot, bring 7 to 8 quarts of water to a boil.  Add 1 tablespoon of salt and the gnocchi.  Cook until the gnocchi are al dente.  They will bob to the top of the cooking water.  Drain the gnocchi well using a handled strainer, and place in a serving dish that has been lined with a thin layer of tomato sauce.  Add the gnocchi, top with additional tomato sauce, toss gently, and serve.

This recipe yields 10 to 12 servings.

Comments:  Saffron, once more precious than gold, was one of the most exotic spices of Renaissance Italy.  It was used mainly as a coloring agent, rather than for taste, to give many dishes eye appeal.  It is still expensive.  Most of it now comes from Spain, but Sardinia also exports it.  What makes saffron so expensive is the fact that the stigmas of the crocus flower, from which saffron is obtained, must be extracted by hand and it takes over a hundred thousand dried stigmas to make one pound of saffron!

I use saffron sparingly in soups and some chicken and fish dishes, and to tint frosting.  A traditional dish in Sardinia made with saffron is Saffron Gnocchi.  My adaptation makes about 12 dozen, if you cut the pieces 1/2 inch in length; however, you can make them 1 inch long if you wish.  Cook what you like and freeze the rest.

              Sicilian Rice Balls - {Arancini Di Siciliani}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                cup  Arborio rice
  3              large  eggs
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino Romano cheese
     1/4           cup  diced mozzarella cheese
     1/2           cup  diced prosciutto or ham - (abt 2 oz)
  3        tablespoons  finely-minced fresh parsley
  2               cups  fresh bread crumbs -- toasted
     1/4           cup  homemade tomato sauce
                        Peanut oil -- for deep-frying

In a saucepan, bring 2 1/2 cups water to a boil.  Add the rice and cook for 15 minutes.  The rice should still be quite firm.  Drain and transfer to a bowl.

Lightly beat one of the eggs and add to the rice, along with the grated cheese, parsley, 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce, and salt and pepper.  Mix well.  Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.  In another bowl, mix the mozzarella cheese, prosciutto or ham, and the remaining 2 tablespoons tomato sauce.

With floured hands, divide the rice mixture into 8 or 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball the size of a small orange.  Poke a hole into the center of each ball with your finger and insert about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the mozzarella mixture.  Reshape and smooth the balls to enclose the filling.

In a shallow dish, beat the remaining 2 eggs.  Spread the bread crumbs on a plate.  Dip the balls into the eggs, turning to coat them well.  Roll the balls in the bread crumbs to coat them evenly.  Then let them dry on a plate for about 45 minutes.

In a deep fryer or deep heavy pan, heat the peanut oil to 375 degrees.  Fry the balls until they are golden brown on all sides.  Drain them on brown paper and serve immediately, with lemon wedges or the fresh tomato sauce.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
                        Olive oil cooking spray -- as needed
  1              large  cauliflower head - (2 lbs) -- washed, and
                        trimmed into 1" florets
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  5        tablespoons  milk
  1              pound  lean ground beef
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/4      teaspoon  coarsely-ground black pepper
     3/4           cup  freshly-grated Pecorino cheese
  1             medium  onion -- coarsely chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  4               cups  prepared tomato sauce of your choice
  1              pound  rigatoni
                        = (or other short type of macaroni)

Coat the bottom of one 13 1/2- by 9-inch baking dish with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and set aside.

Lightly coat another 13 1/2- by 9-inch baking dish and one cookie sheet with olive oil spray and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Dry the cauliflower florets with a kitchen towel and transfer them to the olive-oil-coated baking dish.  Toss them with a spoon to evenly coat them with the oil.  Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the milk and let the mixture stand for a couple of minutes.  Add the beef, oregano, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup of the cheese.  Mix to combine the ingredients, then, with wet hands, form 1-inch meatballs and place them on the cookie sheet.

Bake the meatballs and the cauliflower at the same time, removing the meatballs after 30 minutes and the florets after 40 minutes.  During the cooking time, stir the florets a couple of times.  They should be cooked but hold their shape and be slightly browned.

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat and cook the onion, stirring, until it softens.  Stir in the tomato sauce and heat until hot.  Set aside.

Meanwhile, cook the rigatoni according to package directions, until they are still somewhat firm but not raw.  Drain the rigatoni and transfer them to a large bowl.

Mix the rigatoni with 1 cup of the tomato sauce.  Add the cauliflower and another cup of the tomato sauce and mix well.  Add the meatballs and another cup of the tomato sauce and mix again.

Divide and transfer half of the mixture to each of the baking dishes.  Spread half of the remaining cup tomato sauce over each dish.  Sprinkle the top of each dish with half of the remaining 1/2 cup cheese.

Cover each dish with a sheet of aluminum foil.  Bake, covered, for 20 minutes.  Uncover and bake 5 minutes more.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  In Palermo, Sicily, cauliflower is called broccolo, while in the rest of Italy it is called cavolfiore and is a favorite vegetable for marinated salads, batter-fried, and, most popular of all, combined with macaroni.  The original recipe for this rigatoni-and-cauliflower casserole belonged to Sicilian cook Lucia Pullo Priolisi, whose daughter Marie passed it on to me.  I have made some cooking step changes, preferring to bake the meatballs instead of frying them and roasting the cauliflower at the same time.  This dish is a perfect choice for a crowd because it will easily serve up to sixteen people, and can be made ahead of time and reheated.  Any short-cut pasta can be used but because the pasta will be baked after it is boiled, it should be firmer than usual when drained.

</DirT>
<DirT>
Lightly coat another 13 1/2- by 9-inch baking dish and one cookie sheet with olive oil spray and set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Dry the cauliflower florets with a kitchen towel and transfer them to the olive-oil-coated baking dish.  Toss them with a spoon to evenly coat them with the oil.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs with the milk and let the mixture stand for a couple of minutes.  Add the beef, oregano, salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup of the cheese.  Mix to combine the ingredients, then, with wet hands, form 1-inch meatballs and place them on the cookie sheet.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Bake the meatballs and the cauliflower at the same time, removing the meatballs after 30 minutes and the florets after 40 minutes.  During the cooking time, stir the florets a couple of times.  They should be cooked but hold their shape and be slightly browned.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium heat and cook the onion, stirring, until it softens.  Stir in the tomato sauce and heat until hot.  Set aside.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Meanwhile, cook the rigatoni according to package directions, until they are still somewhat firm but not raw.  Drain the rigatoni and transfer them to a large bowl.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Mix the rigatoni with 1 cup of the tomato sauce.  Add the cauliflower and another cup of the tomato sauce and mix well.  Add the meatballs and another cup of the tomato sauce and mix again.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Divide and transfer half of the mixture to each of the baking dishes.  Spread half of the remaining cup tomato sauce over each dish.  Sprinkle the top of each dish with half of the remaining 1/2 cup cheese.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cover each dish with a sheet of aluminum foil.  Bake, covered, for 20 minutes.  Uncover and bake 5 minutes more.  Serve immediately.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 16 servings.

Comments:  In Palermo, Sicily, cauliflower is called broccolo, while in the rest of Italy it is called cavolfiore and is a favorite vegetable for marinated salads, batter-fried, and, most popular of all, combined with macaroni.  The original recipe for this rigatoni-and-cauliflower casserole belonged to Sicilian cook Lucia Pullo Priolisi, whose daughter Marie passed it on to me.  I have made some cooking step changes, preferring to bake the meatballs instead of frying them and roasting the cauliflower at the same time.  This dish is a perfect choice for a crowd because it will easily serve up to sixteen people, and can be made ahead of time and reheated.  Any short-cut pasta can be used but because the pasta will be baked after it is boiled, it should be firmer than usual when drained.

                Small Pasta Molds - {Timballini Di Pasta}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 3/4           cups  diced leeks
     1/4         pound  pancetta or bacon -- diced
     1/3           cup  minced flat-leaf parsley
  1            package  frozen petite peas - (10 oz) -- thawed
  3               cups  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        = (or prepared tomato sauce)
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  capellini or angel hair pasta -- broken into thirds
  2               cups  freshly-grated Asiago or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese - (5 oz)
  20                    aluminum foil cupcake cups
                        = (3" wide and 1 1/2" deep)

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil.  Add the leeks and pancetta or bacon and cook over medium heat until the leeks begin to wilt and the pancetta starts to brown.  Add the parsley and cook for 1 minute.  Add the peas and cook for 1 minute.  Add 2 cups of the tomato sauce and stir well.  Add the salt and pepper, cover the pan and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly oil the aluminum foil cups.  Bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot.  Add the pasta and cook just until al dente.  Drain the pasta well and place it in a bowl.  Add the leek mixture and cheese and mix well with a wooden spoon.  Add the remaining 1 cup tomato sauce and mix again.

Divide the mixture among the foil cups, making sure to distribute it evenly.  Press down the pasta lightly with the back of a spoon to compact the ingredients.  Place the cups on cookie sheets.  Cover loosely with foil and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the timballini are heated through.

To unmold, using a potholder or oven mitt, carefully invert the molds onto a large platter or onto individual dishes.

Variation:  Instead of making timballini, use the leek mixture to sauce 1 pound of farfalle bow ties or other pasta for a simple supper for four.

This recipe yields 20 timballini.

Comments:  Timballini are small neat molds made with meats, vegetables, or, as in this case, with pasta.  These are flecked with bright green peas, pancetta, and parsley and bound together with fresh tomato sauce.  They make a bright and unusual addition to a Christmas buffet.  You can make the sauce several days in advance and assemble the timballini one day ahead, then bake just before serving.

                         Spaghetti Alla Carbonara

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  chunk bacon or pancetta -- cubed
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove
  2                     eggs
  2                     egg yolks
     1/4           cup  grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino cheese
                        Good grinding coarse black pepper
  1              pound  spaghetti

Brown the bacon in a pan with the olive oil and the garlic.  Discard the garlic when it begins to brown.  Set the bacon aside.

In a large warmed bowl mix the eggs, egg yolks, cheeses and pepper together.  Keep the mixture warm.  I usually set the bowl in the sink with very warm water around it

Cook the spaghetti in 4 quarts of rapidly boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Cook until the spaghetti is al dente, firm but cooked through.  As soon as it is cooked, drain it, add it to the warm egg mixture and toss quickly to coat the spaghetti.  Sprinkle the bacon over the top and serve.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

                   Spaghetti With Asparagus Tips - ...

Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2                     garlic cloves -- peeled and sliced
  2             pounds  thin asparagus -- trimmed, and
                        tips cut 1" long
  6              large  plum tomatoes -- peeled, and
                        cut into small pieces
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt -- plus
  1         tablespoon  fine sea salt
                        Grinding coarse black pepper
  1              pound  spaghetti
     1/4           cup  reserved cooking water
     1/4           cup  grated Pecorino cheese -- plus
                        extra for sprinkling on top

Heat the olive oil in a saute pan large enough to accommodate the cooked spaghetti (at least 12-inches in diameter).  Stir in the garlic and asparagus and cook until they begin to brown slightly.  Stir in the tomatoes, 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper, lower the heat, cover the pan and cook the mixture for 5 minutes or just until a knife is easily inserted into the asparagus tips.

Keep the sauce warm while the spaghetti is cooking.

Bring 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil in a pasta pot.  Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt and spaghetti.  Cook until the spaghetti is al dente, firm but cooked through.  Drain the spaghetti, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.  Add the water and spaghetti to the pan with the asparagus sauce.  Over medium heat, reheat the mixture, stirring quickly to blend all the ingredients.  Sprinkle the cheese over the top and stir in.

Transfer the spaghetti and asparagus sauce to a platter and serve immediately.  Pass extra cheese for sprinkling on top.

This recipe yields 6 servings.

Comments:  Asparagus grows wild, thin, and tall in Umbria and there are many favorite ways to prepare it, including grilled, marinated in salads and combined with spaghetti.  In this dish only the asparagus tips (punte) are used; save the slender stems to use in soups or sauteed with other vegetables.

       Spaghetti With Black Truffles - {Spaghetti Ai Tartufi Neri}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     fresh black truffles
                        = (or 2 canned, if you must)
     2/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              pound  spaghetti
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
                        Grated Pecorino cheese -- (optional)

If the truffles are dirty, brush them with a mushroom brush or a paper towel.  Slice them very thin with a truffle slicer, a sharp knife, or on a box cheese grater.  Place the truffles in a shallow dish and pour the olive oil over them.  Cover them with plastic wrap, and allow them to remain at room temperature for several hours or overnight.

Cook the spaghetti, following the package directions or the directions for freshly made pasta.

While the spaghetti is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in which the truffles are marinating in a large skillet, and cook the garlic until it is soft but not browned.  Turn off the heat and add the remaining olive oil and the truffles.

Drain the spaghetti, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Add the spaghetti and the water to the skillet with the truffles.  Reheat the mixture over very low heat just until it is hot.  Stir in the salt.  Transfer the mixture to a platter and serve immediately.  Pass the cheese on the side.

This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Black truffles are known as trifolati in Umbrian dialect.  One of the easiest and most tasty uses for them is in spaghetti ai tartufi neri, spaghetti with black truffles.  To get the most flavor soak the shaved truffle slices in a good extra virgin olive oil for a day before putting the dish together.

If the truffles are dirty, brush them with a mushroom brush or a paper towel.  Slice them very thin with a truffle slicer, a sharp knife, or on a box cheese grater.  Place the truffles in a shallow dish and pour the olive oil over them.  Cover them with plastic wrap, and allow them to remain at room temperature for several hours or overnight.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Cook the spaghetti, following the package directions or the directions for freshly made pasta.
</DirT>
<DirT>
While the spaghetti is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in which the truffles are marinating in a large skillet, and cook the garlic until it is soft but not browned.  Turn off the heat and add the remaining olive oil and the truffles.
</DirT>
<DirT>
Drain the spaghetti, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.  Add the spaghetti and the water to the skillet with the truffles.  Reheat the mixture over very low heat just until it is hot.  Stir in the salt.  Transfer the mixture to a platter and serve immediately.  Pass the cheese on the side.
</DirT>
<DirT>
This recipe yields 4 servings.

Comments:  Black truffles are known as trifolati in Umbrian dialect.  One of the easiest and most tasty uses for them is in spaghetti ai tartufi neri, spaghetti with black truffles.  To get the most flavor soak the shaved truffle slices in a good extra virgin olive oil for a day before putting the dish together.

                 Spinach And Ricotta Cheese Gnocchi - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 10    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  fresh whole milk ricotta
  2             pounds  fresh spinach -- washed and stemmed
     2/3           cup  grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
  2                     jumbo eggs
  12                    mint leaves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  sea salt
     1/2      teaspoon  grated nutmeg
  1               dash  freshly-ground white pepper
  1 3/4           cups  unbleached all purpose flour -- more or less
  12       tablespoons  unsalted butter
  10             small  sage leaves -- minced

Drain the ricotta cheese in a cheesecloth-lined strainer set over a bowl until it is very dry.  Transfer the cheese to a large bowl and set it aside.

Cook the spinach in batches in a covered large soup pot with no additional water until the spinach has wilted.  Drain it in a colander, and when cool enough to handle, squeeze the spinach as dry as possible with your hands to remove excess water.  You should have about 2 cups of squeezed spinach.

Chop the spinach coarsely, then puree it in a blender or food processor until it is very smooth.  Transfer the spinach to the bowl with the cheese and stir in 1/3 cup of the grated cheese, eggs, mint, salt, nutmeg and pepper, and mix well.  Begin adding the flour a little at a time until a soft dough is obtained and is not sticking to your hands.

It is easier to form the gnocchi if the dough is refrigerated for several hours or overnight.

Lightly flour a work surface.  Using two soupspoons, shape heaping tablespoons of the dough into an oval or egg shape then gently slide the dough off the spoon onto the floured surface.

Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil.  With a spoon, scoop up about 8 to 10 gnocchi at a time and add them to the water.  Boil them until they float.

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large saute pan and stir in the sage leaves.  Cover the pan and keep the sauce warm.

Use a slotted spoon to remove and transfer the gnocchi to the sauce tossing them gently until well coated with the sauce.

Divide between 8 individual plates and sprinkle with the remaining 1/3 cup of cheese.  Serve hot.

This recipe yields 8 to 10 servings.

Comments:  Spinach and ricotta gnocchi are a first course reserved for my very favorite guestsand they are a traditional Tuscan favorite!  These have a vibrant forest green color and are light and fluffy.  As with most dough preparations for gnocchi, it is the amount of flour used that will determine if their texture is light or leaden.  Be sure to really squeeze as much water as possible out of the spinach or you will end up using too much flour.  Patience is a virtue when making gnocchi.

                Squash Gnocchi - {Gnocchi Di Zucca Gialla}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  butternut squash -- cut into quarters
  1                cup  unbleached all-purpose flour
  4                     egg yolks -- slightly beaten
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
     1/4      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/3           cup  finely-diced dried apricots
     1/2           cup  grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
  4        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Put the squash chunks in a casserole dish large enough to hold them in a single layer.  Pour in 1/2 cup of water and cover the dish with a piece of aluminum foil.  Bake the squash until a knife is easily inserted into a chunk.  This will take about 45 minutes.

Let the squash cool until it is easy for you to handle.  Scrape and discard the seeds, then scoop the squash into a bowl and throw away the skins.  Mash the squash with a fork to smooth it out.  You will need 1 1/2 cups to make one recipe.  Stir in the flour, egg yolks, salt, cinnamon, 1/4 cup of the cheese, and all of the apricots.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate it at least 2 hours or overnight.  This will make it easier for you to handle it.

Butter a casserole dish and set it aside.  Bring a large pot of water to the boil.

To form the gnocchi, use two soupspoons to scoop up some of the batter and drop it into the boiling water.  Do not crowd the pot.  Make six to eight at a time.  When they bob to the surface of the water, take them out with a slotted spoon and transfer them to the casserole dish.  Keep them warm and covered until all the batter is used.

Melt the butter in a small pan and pour it over the top of the gnocchi.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top and bake the gnocchi for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until heated through.  Plan on 4 or 5 as an individual serving.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  It is almost impossible to allocate the exact amount of flour that a recipe for potato gnocchi will need.  The flour used, the size of the eggs, the type of potato, the way the dough is worked, all these are factors.  In making dough you will know by the feel of it if the dough is the right consistency, so if it doesn't come out just perfect the first time, don't be afraid to start over.  Eventually your hands will talk to you and let you know when enough is enough (flour, that is).  This gnocchi dough is made with butternut squash and makes a thick batter-like dough that is dropped like a dumpling into boiling water.  It is a traditional Umbrian dish from Gubbio, usually served with finely shaved white truffles over the top.  Since white truffles are very expensive and hard to come by, I added diced dried apricots when I made them for the first time; this gave them a subtle, sweet flavor and I dedicated the first bite to those inspirational women chefs at Le Noci.  Serve these as a first course.

           Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce - {Salsa Di Pomodori Secchi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Sauces

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  olive oil
  1              large  garlic clove -- peeled and minced
  4                     anchovies in olive oil -- drained and chopped
  1         tablespoon  salted capers -- rinsed
  1                cup  oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes
  4        tablespoons  dry red wine
                        Coarsely-ground black pepper -- to taste
                        Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for serving

In a skillet, heat the olive oil, add the garlic and anchovies, and stir with a wooden spoon until the anchovies dissolve into the oil.  Add the capers, tomatoes, and wine and cook 2 minutes, stirring often.  Transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse until the tomatoes are in small bits.  Return the sauce to the skillet and reheat just before serving.

This recipe yields 1 cup.

Comments:  I demonstrated this sauce for guests at a dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Boston.  From the looks on peoples' faces, it was a winner.  This dense sauce can be made in minutes.  Be sure to toss and coat the spaghetti or rigatoni well with the sauce.

                         Thick Noodles - {Pinci}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
     1/8      teaspoon  fine sea salt
  1              large  egg -- slightly beaten
                        Warm water -- as needed
                        Little Cubed Bread Sauce -- (see recipe)

To make the dough by hand, heap the flours with the salt on a work surface and mix them together with your hands.  Make a hole in the center of the flour and add the egg; begin mixing the flour from the inside of the wall into the egg.  When you have a rough mass, push the excess flour out of the way and knead the dough into a smooth ball.  If the mixture seems dry as you form the dough, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until you have the right consistency.  Cover the dough with a bowl and allow it to rest for 30 minutes to relax the gluten.

If using a food processor, place all the flour and salt in the bowl of the processor and whirl to blend.  Add the egg and water, if needed, through the feed tube.  Process until a ball forms around the blade.  Remove and cover the dough as above.

To form the pinci, divide the dough in half; work with one half at a time and keep the rest covered.  On a floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle the thickness of pizza dough.  Cut 9 1/4-inch wide strips from the dough.  Anchor one end of the strip with one hand, and with the other roll and stretch each one under your palm creating a thick looking strand.  Coil each one loosely around your hand, forming a "nest" and place them on a towel sprinkled with semolina.

To cook, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Add 1 tablespoon of sea salt, and 1 teaspoon of olive oil.  Lift the pinci from the towel and drop into the water.  Cook until al dente.  These will be a little chewier than regular spaghetti because of their thickness.  Drain and toss the pinci with Salsa Di Briciole or a sauce of your choice.

This recipe yields 5 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Tasting pinci, a thick type of spaghetti, is a good enough reason to visit the wine country of Montalcino.  And Chef Maria Gorelli turns them out by hand faster than any machine can in the Castle Banfi kitchen.  In other parts of Tuscany, these delicious noodles are called pici, which just goes to show how localized the cuisine of Tuscany can be.  Make the dough in a food processor or by hand.  If you do not want to make the pinci from scratch, substitute bucatini, a thicker cut of dried pasta found in grocery stores.

To make the dough by hand, heap the flours with the salt on a work surface and mix them together with your hands.  Make a hole in the center of the flour and add the egg; begin mixing the flour from the inside of the wall into the egg.  When you have a rough mass, push the excess flour out of the way and knead the dough into a smooth ball.  If the mixture seems dry as you form the dough, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time until you have the right consistency.  Cover the dough with a bowl and allow it to rest for 30 minutes to relax the gluten.

                 Thick Spaghetti With Bread Crumbs - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  1 1/2           cups  coarse fresh bread crumbs
  1         tablespoon  sugar
  1              pound  perciatelli
                        = (or spaghetti)
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt

Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saute pan.  Add the bread crumbs and stir with a wooden spoon to coat them with the oil.  Cook the crumbs over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown in color.  Remove the crumbs to a bowl, stir in the sugar, and set aside.

Cook the perciatelli according to the instructions.  Drain the pasta, reserving 2 tablespoons of the cooking water.

Return the pasta to the cooking pot, stir in the water, the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil, and the salt.  Transfer the pasta to a platter.  Sprinkle half of the bread crumbs over the top and, with two spoons, toss the pasta to evenly coat the strands with the crumbs.  Sprinkle the remaining crumbs over the top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Perciatelli is similar to spaghetti but thicker and hollow.  It is also called bucatini and is very popular in southern Italy.  In Salemi, Sicily, I ate perciatelli on the Feast of St. Joseph, the carpenter, served with "toasted" bread crumbs that had been tossed with a little sugar.  Some say that the bread crumbs are symbolic of the wood shavings of a carpenter and the sugar is always an ingredient because on the feast, the Holy Family, often portrayed by children, are the first to eat this dish.  A coarse-type bread makes the best crumbs; soft bread will not have enough texture and crunch to hold up when tossed with the cooked pasta.  Serve as a first course followed by roasted chicken or capon.

               Thick Spaghetti With Green Cauliflower - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  1              large  onion -- diced
  3                     anchovy fillets in olive oil -- drained and minced
  1            package  powdered saffron - (1/30 oz or a pinch) -- dissolved in
     1/4           cup  warm water
     1/2           cup  pine nuts
     1/3           cup  currants or diced raisins
  4             quarts  water - (to 6)
  2 1/2    tablespoons  fine sea salt
  1               head  green cauliflower - (1 1/2 lbs) -- washed, trimmed,
                        and cut into small florets
  1              pound  bucatini, perciatelli, or spaghetti
  2        tablespoons  tomato paste

Heat the olive oil in a deep, large saute pan, then cook the onion, stirring, over medium heat until it softens.  Stir in the anchovies and cook until they dissolve in the pan.  Stir in the dissolved saffron.  Stir in the pine nuts and currants or raisins and cook for 1 minute.  Turn off the heat and set the pan aside.

Bring the 4 to 6 quarts of water to a boil in a pasta pot with an insert.  Add 2 tablespoons of the salt and the cauliflower.  Cook just until the stems are tender, about 3 minutes.  Remove the florets with a slotted spoon and transfer to the pan with the onion mixture.

Cook the bucatini in the same water according to the package directions.  Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water in a small bowl.  Transfer the bucatini to the pan with the onion-and-cauliflower mixture and stir to combine the ingredients.

Stir the tomato paste into the reserved water and pour it into the pan with the onions and cauliflower.  Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon salt, quickly reheat the mixture until hot, and transfer it to a serving dish.  Serve immediately.

Note:  Instead of purchasing tomato paste in cans, buy it in tube form.  This allows you to use the amount you need without having to open a can for just a small amount.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Broccoflower or green cauliflower is called broccoli in Palermo, Sicily, and what we know as broccoli is called sparaceddi.  It is often combined with a thicker cut of spaghetti called bucatini or perciatelli and flavored with an unusual sauce combination of currants, anchovies, pine nuts, and saffron.  Some may be skeptical of the taste, but in this dish, one understands that the Sicilians need look no further than their own island for the ingredients and flavors that have for centuries defined their cuisine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FOR THE PASTA ===
  4             quarts  water -- (4 to 6)
  2        tablespoons  salt
  1              pound  homemade or store-bought Fusilli
  1         tablespoon  extra-virgin olive oil
                        === FOR THE SAUCE ===
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     anchovy fillets in salt -- rinsed and dried
  2             ounces  green olives in brine -- drained, pitted,
                        and diced
  1 3/4           cups  Tomato And Basil Sauce -- (see recipe)
  5             ounces  fresh Mozzarella (fior di latte) -- diced
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
                        Grinding of black Pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  dried oregano

Bring the water to a boil in a pasta pot with an insert.  Add the salt and Fusilli.  For commercially pre­pared Fusilli, follow package directions.  For homemade, the cooking time will be less but more than for most types of homemade pasta because of their thickness.  Cook until al dente, 4 to 5 minutes.  Drain the Fusilli and place them in a large bowl.  Toss with the 1 tablespoon olive oil, cover, and set aside.

Heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium-size saucepan over low heat, stir in the anchovies with a wooden spoon, and cook until they almost dissolve into the oil.  Stir in the olives and tomato sauce, bring the ingredients to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in the mozzarella, pour the sauce over the fusilli, and mix everything together very quickly, allowing the cheese to melt.  Add the salt, pepper, and oregano, toss again, and transfer the mixture to a pasta platter.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields ?? servings.

                                 Trenette

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
     1/2           cup  semolina flour
  1           teaspoon  fine sea salt
  2              large  eggs
     1/2           cup  filtered water

Combine the flours and salt and mound on a work surface.  With your fist, make a hole in the center of the mound.  Break the eggs into the center and add the water.  Mix with a fork to break up the yolks and blend in the water.  Using one hand and moving in a clockwise fashion, begin bringing the flour from inside the flour wall into the eggs.  Use your other hand to keep the outside of the wall together.  If the wall breaks, the eggs will seep out.  Continue mixing until a ball of dough is created that is not soupy and holds its shape.  Push the excess flour aside and knead the dough until a smooth, soft ball is obtained.

Roll out and cut the dough as for fettucine, then let dry.

This recipe yields 1 pound for 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Trennette (bavette) are thin noodles from Liguria made with water in addition to eggs and flour.  I find that tap water can leave an aftertaste, so use filtered or bottled water if possible.  The dough is very elastic and not as yellow as the basic recipe for Pasta Fatta a Mano.

           Trenette With Pesto, Potatoes, And Green Beans - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4             quarts  water - (to 6)
  1         tablespoon  salt
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled and diced
     1/2         pound  green beans -- trimmed, and
                        cut into 1" diagonal pieces
  1              pound  Trenette -- (see recipe)
     1/2           cup  Pesto Sauce -- (see recipe)
                        Freshly-grated Pecorino or
                        Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese -- for sprinkling

Bring the water to a boil in a pasta pot.  Add the salt, potatoes, and green beans and cook until the vegetables are al dente, tender but still firm, about 4 minutes.  Add the pasta, stir it with a pasta fork, cover the pot, and bring the water back to a boil.  Uncover the pot and cook the pasta just until al dente, about 3 minutes.  Drain the pasta and vegetables into a colander, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water.  Return the pasta and vegetables to the pot.

In a small bowl, combine the prepared pesto sauce with just enough of the reserved cooking water to make a smooth consistency.  Pour the sauce over the pasta.  Gently combine and mix the ingredients well over low heat.  Transfer the pasta and vegetables to a platter or bowl and serve immediately.  Pass additional cheese on the side.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  This recipe combines pasta from Liguria called trenette and pesto with potatoes and green beans, and is a specialty found in Cinque Terre and Portofino.  Linguine can be used instead of the homemade Trenette.

                     Tuscan Herb Rub - {Erbe Toscane}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Condiments                      Italian
                Rubs

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  rosemary needles
  1                cup  sage leaves
  4              large  garlic cloves
  2          teaspoons  coarse salt
                        = (Diamond Kosher is best)

Make a pile of the rosemary, sage, garlic and salt on a cutting board.  Use a chef's knife or a mezzaluna (rocking knife) and mince the ingredients.  Spread the mixture on the cutting board or on paper towels and allow it to dry overnight.

Transfer the mixture to a jar and store it in the refrigerator.

Use it to rub on pork roasts, chicken, mix it into sauteing vegetables and soups.  It makes a great little culinary gift, too.

Vary the herbs and add herbs like thyme, lemon zest, fennel seeds, or fennel pollen.

This recipe yields 3 cups.

Comments:  One of the things I have learned in the Tuscan kitchens that I have visited is that one must always have a jar of erbe toscane (Tuscan herbs) on hand for rubbing into roasts and using for general cooking.  The most favored herbs are rosemary, sage, and garlic.  This is a great way to utilize the herbs in your garden.

                   Twisted Pasta With Leek Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2             pounds  leeks -- well washed,
                        and trimmed of the dark green stem
     1/4           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter
  2                     garlic cloves -- cut thin slivers
     1/2           cup  dry vermouth
     1/2           cup  chicken broth
  1 1/2      teaspoons  fine sea salt - (to 2)
                        Grinding of coarse black pepper
  1              pound  fusilli
                        Water for cooking the pasta -- reserving 1/4 cup
                        of the cooking water for the sauce
  1         tablespoon  salt

Cut the leeks into thin rings.  You should have about 4 cups.  Set aside.

In a large saute pan (12 by 3 inches), heat the olive oil and the butter and stir to blend the two.  Stir in the leeks and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the leeks begin to soften.  Stir in the garlic, and cook for 2 minutes, pressing on the garlic slivers.  Raise the heat to high and stir in the vermouth.  Cook over high heat for 2 minutes.  Lower the heat and stir in the chicken broth, salt, and pepper.  Simmer the sauce for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the leeks have become very creamy.  Cover the pan, set aside, and keep warm while the fusilli are cooking.

Cook the fusilli in 4 to 6 quarts of rapidly boiling water to which 1 tablespoon of salt has been added.  Do not overcook the fusilli; they should retain their shape, and be cooked through, but not mushy.  One way to test for doneness is to break a piece of pasta in half and if any trace of flour is evident, the pasta is not cooked.

Drain the fusilli, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking water.  Transfer fusilli to the saute pan with the leek sauce.  Stir in the water and mix the fusilli and sauce over medium heat until well blended.

Transfer the fusilli and leek sauce to a shallow platter and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Over the years I have had the privilege of cooking with some very talented chefs and amateur cooks and have invited many of them to appear in my television studio kitchen.  One of the most frequent visitors has been the well-known children's illustrator and author Tomie di Paola, whose family is from Calabria.  Tomie brings not only a knowledge of Calabrian cooking to my kitchen, he also brings an earthy joy and an adventuresome attitude to preparing good food.  In one episode showcasing pasta, we filmed in Tomie's well-appointed kitchen, where he made fusilli with an outstanding creamy leek sauce.  The secret is to slow-cook the leeks until they become very liquid and creamy.  When I asked Tomie where this recipe came from, he was quick to say that one night when some friends unexpectedly were in town, he invited them to dinner before looking in the refrigerator.  Only a handful of leeks graced the shelf, so in a pinch this recipe was created.

                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
  1              pound  large meaty plum tomatoes - (abt 3 or 4)
  4        tablespoons  butter - (1/2 stick)

Pour the olive oil into a glass bowl and set aside.  On a cutting board, place the garlic, basil, and parsley in a mound, mince the ingredients together with a knife, and add to the olive oil.

Core and cut the tomatoes in half and squeeze out the seeds.  Dice the tomatoes and add them with the salt and pepper to the olive oil.  Blend the sauce well with a spoon, cover the dish with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for several hours for use the same day.

To serve, divide cooked spaghetti among individual serving bowls, then divide the sauce among the dishes, placing it on top of the spaghetti in the center.  Add a tablespoon of butter to each bowl, and serve.

This recipe yields 2 cups.

Comments:  On a recent trip to Italy, I had dinner at Benvenuto, a restaurant in Florence that the locals would rather tourists not know about.  Before the restaurant opens regular customers line up in front of the place.  Finally the owner unlocks the door and everyone files in, first to greet Cesare, the talking myna bird who bids each a Buon Giorno, and then to stake out a spot at long communal tables, where friends and strangers break bread together.  The menu is typical Tuscan fare, but one of the best dishes is a simple plate of spaghetti topped with an uncooked tomato sauce and a knob of butter.  This is the perfect quick-and-easy sauce to make when tomatoes, basil, and parsley are in season.  The sauce can be prepared two days ahead and stored in the refrigerator.

              Walter Potenza's Risotto With Asparagus - ...

Recipe By     :Walter Potenza
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Appetizers                      Italian
                Rice/Grains

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1         tablespoon  unsalted butter
                        = (or 1/2 tbspn butter and 1/2 tbspn
                        extra-virgin olive oil}
  1             medium  onion -- diced
  1                cup  Arborio rice
  5               cups  vegetable broth
  1              pound  asparagus
  2        tablespoons  unsalted butter

Melt the butter in a large frying pan and saute the onion until it is transparent.  Add the rice and mix it with the butter to coat the grains; cook until the rice looks toasted and has a light caramel color.

Start adding the broth, a little at a time, stirring constantly.  When the liquid is absorbed, add a little more of the broth and continue until all the broth has been added.

Pour the completed mixture out onto a buttered marble board and smooth it to a depth of 1/2-inch.  Try to form the risotto into a 6- to 9-inch square so that the serving portions will be fairly symmetrical.  Lightly score the top of the rice into 3- to 4-inch squares.  Allow the mixture to set up for 5 to 10 minutes.

Clean the asparagus and discard any tough ends.  Slice them into bite-size lengths, cutting them on the diagonal.  Saute the asparagus in the same frying pan until the tip of a knife penetrates easily.  Reheat the serving-size squares of risotto and top with the asparagus.  Serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 appetizer servings.

                  Wide Homemade Noodles - {Pappardelle}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 0     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3               cups  unbleached all-purpose flour
  4              large  eggs
     1/4      teaspoon  fine sea salt

Dump the flour in a heap on a work surface and use your hands to make a hole, or fontana as Italian cooks call it, in the middle of the flour.  Crack the eggs into the center, add the salt and use your hands to whip them around to break them up.

Begin bringing some of the flour from the inside of the flour wall into the center, mixing it with the eggs.  Continue like this until enough of the flour has been added to make a rough looking ball of dough.  Push the excess flour aside, and knead the dough until it becomes smooth with no bumpy spots, and it is not sticking to your hands.  The dough should feel soft; adding too much flour will produce a dry dough.

Now form the dough into a ball and put it on a lightly floured surface.  Put a bowl over the top of it and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes.  This will help relax the gluten in the dough and make it easier to roll out.

Cut the dough into thirds and work with one piece at a time; keep the remaining pieces covered so they do not dry out.

Use a rolling pin to roll the pieces out on a lightly floured surface into a 14- by 16-inch wide rectangle that is about 1/16 of an inch thick.  I use a pastry wheel to cut 1/2-inch-wide strips to make the pappardelle.  After cutting them, put them on clean towels to dry or to hold until ready to cook them.

To cook pappardelle or any other fresh pasta, start with a large pot of boiling water, at least 4 to 6 quarts of water is my rule.  Add 1 tablespoon of salt to the boiling water for every pound of pasta.  Add the pappardelle.  Remember that fresh pasta cooks in no time at all, and should remain al dente, meaning it should be firm, not mushy but cooked through.  Cook the pappardelle for no longer than 3 to 4 minutes.  Drain it in a colander and toss it with your favorite sauce.

This recipe yields 1 1/4 pounds.

Comments:  Graziella and Gaetana can make just about every type of fresh pasta including pappardelle, wide noodles so light in texture that it is conceivable that too many could be consumed with no difficulty at all!  And that is not surprising, given that the word pappardelle means to gorge!  They are often served with wild hare.

               Wide Noodles With Mixed Mushroom Sauce - ...

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/3           cup  extra-virgin olive oil
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  12            ounces  assorted mushrooms -- stemmed, sliced thin
                        = (porcini, portobello, oyster, shitake)
  3             pounds  fresh tomatoes -- skinned, seeded,
                        and chopped
                        Salt -- to taste
                        Freshly-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/2           cup  minced fresh mint
     1/2         pound  pappardelle
                        = (store-bought or homemade)

Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a saute pan and cook the garlic until it is soft but not browned.  Add the mushrooms along with the remaining olive oil and cook until they soften and render their juices.  Stir in the tomatoes, salt and pepper and cook the sauce covered over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in the mint and cook 1 minute longer.  Turn off the heat and keep the sauce covered while the pappardelle cook.

Cook the pappardelle according to the directions.  Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water and add it to the sauce.  Transfer the pappardelle to a bowl, stir in the sauce and serve piping hot.

Note:  Adding herbs when a dish is almost cooked preserves more of its essential oil than adding them at the beginning, since too much cooking will destroy the taste.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Wild mint is the distinguishing flavor in this mushroom sauce for pappardelle, the wide noodle so popular in Tuscany.  Teamed with an orchestra of assorted mushrooms, porcini, portobello, shitake, and oyster, it is easy to make and elegant enough for company.  Traditionally this dish is served senza formaggio, without cheese.

           Ziti With Four Cheeses - {Ziti Con Quattro Formaggi}

Recipe By     :Mary Ann Esposito
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Italian                         Main Dish
                Pasta

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter
     1/2           cup  fresh bread crumbs
  1              pound  ziti
     1/2           cup  diced Fontina cheese
     1/2           cup  diced fresh mozzarella cheese
     1/2           cup  diced Asiago cheese
     1/2           cup  freshly-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-grated nutmeg
                        Fine sea salt -- to taste
     1/2           cup  heavy cream

To "toast" the bread crumbs heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small saute pan, add the bread crumbs, and cook them until golden brown.  Transfer the crumbs to a small bowl and set side.

Cook the ziti according to the package directions.  Drain and return to the pasta pot.  Over low heat, stir the ziti with the remaining 4 tablespoons butter until it is well coated.  Scatter the Fontina, mozzarella, and Asiago cheeses over the top and let them remain on top for 1 to 2 minutes to warm over low heat.  Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon to melt the cheeses, then stir in the Parmigiano, nutmeg, salt, and heavy cream until well mixed.

Transfer the macaroni and cheese to a serving plat­ter.  Sprinkle the toasted bread crumbs over the top and serve immediately.

This recipe yields 4 to 6 servings.

Comments:  Everyone has their favorite comfort food and mine is this rich and quick-to-make macaroni and cheese with four cheeses that is a specialty of the Hotel Belvedere Syrene in Sorrento.  Instead of making a cream sauce, mixing in the pasta, and baking the dish in the oven, the cheeses are added directly to the hot pasta and stirred over low heat to melt them and served immediately.  Use a short cut of pasta such as ziti, rigatoni, or medium shells.
