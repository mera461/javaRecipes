Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl and let it dissolve for 5 minutes.  Put the milk and shortening in a saucepan and heat until the shortening is melted.  Cool to lukewarm.

Pour the yeast mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the milk mix.  Stir in the 1/4 cup sugar, salt, nutmeg, eggs, and 2 cups flour.  Beat briskly until well blended.  Add the remaining 2 1/2 cups flour and beat until smooth.  Cover the bowl and let double in bulk, about 1 hour.

Dust a board generously with flour and turn the dough mass onto it.  This dough is soft and needs enough flour on the board to prevent sticking, but is easy to handle.  Pat the dough into a round about 1/2 inch thick.  Use a 3 inch doughnut cutter and cut out the doughnuts,  placing them (and the doughnut holes) on greased baking sheets, 1 inch apart.  These don't spread much; they rise.  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  Let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered.  Bake about 10 minutes or a little longer, until they have a touch of golden brown.  Remove from the oven.  Have ready the melted butter and a brush.  On a sheet of wax paper, spread the cinnamon sugar.  Brush each doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon sugar.

Place walnuts on a jellyroll pan and toast in a moderate oven (350F) for 10 minutes.  Whirl walnuts while still warm, 1/2 cup at a time, in a blender until finely ground.  Mix together with sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl.

Brush bottom of a 13x9x2 baking pan with melted butter.  Fold two phyllo leaves in half; place on bottom of pan; brush with butter.  Place 2 more folded leaves in pan, brush with butter.

Sprinkle top with 1/2 cup nut mixture.  Add two more folded leaves; brush with butter.

Repeat above step five more times.  Stack remaining leaves, brushing every other one.  Brush top leaf with the remaining butter; sprinkle with the tablespoon of water.

With a sharp knife, cutting through the top layer of phyllo only, make 5 lengthwise cuts 1 1/2 inch apart.  Then cut diagonally again at 1 1/2 inch intervals, making diamonds.

Bake in a preheated 325F oven for 50 minutes, until top is golden.  Remove pan to wire rack.  Cut all the way through the diamonds, separating slightly.  Pour cooled honey syrup over.  Cool thoroughly in pan on rack.  Cover with foil; let stand at room temperature overnight for syrup to be absorbed.


Honey Syrup:

Grate the rind from the lemon and reserve.  Squeeze out 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice into a small cup; set aside.

Place lemon rind, sugar, water, cinnamon stick and cloves in a heavy saucepan.  Bring to boiling, lower heat, continue cooking, without stirring, 25 minutes, or until mixture is syrupy (230F on a candy thermometer).

Stir in honey; pour through a strainer into a 2-cup measure.  Stir in reserved lemon juice.  Cool

Syrup:
Dissolve 3 cups sugar in 1 1/2 cups water.  Bring to a medium boil for 10 minutes.  Squeeze 1/2 lemon into it and boil for another minute or two.  At this point it should be a little thick, not as thick as corn syrup, but not like water.  Add 1 teaspoon orange blossom water or vanilla.

Mix nuts and spices together.  Melt some unsalted butter and let separate over low heat.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Spread the phyllo dough and cut it into nine (3x3) equal sections.  Stack three layer of dough, brushing the bottom two layers with butter.  Place 1 tsp of nuts at one end and roll tightly.  Repeat until you've used up all the dough.  

Place the rolled up pieces in a buttered baking pan, leave no space between pieces.  Brush the top with butter.

Bake for 15 minutes at 350F.  Lower to 300F and bake until lightly golden (lift one of the pieces and check the bottom).  This should take 15 - 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and pour the syrup on it immediately.  Let it sit for about an hour to absorb the syrup.  After the first few minutes you might want to tilt the tray back and forth a couple times to make sure the syrup spreads around.

Place patties on preheated barbecue grill.  Broil 3 to 4 inches from source of heat, basting with sauce and turning patties over from time to time for even browning.  Grill 12 to 15 minutes total or to your liking - time depends on how well you like your meat done.

Serve meat patties on hamburger buns, if you like, or with French fries.  Serve remaining basting sauce alongside.

Beat the eggs until light and lemon-colored.  Gradually beat in the sugar until the mixtrue is thick and ribbony.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg.  Add this to the beaten eggs and sugar alternately with the milk and melted butterm and stir lightly until the flour is moistened.  Allow the mixture to stand about 15 minutes.  If the dough should seem very thin, chillit 30 minutes before rolling.  Take half the dough and roll about 3/4 inch thick.  cut with floured doughnut cutter, and be sure to save the holes.  They are most delicious when fried.  With the aid of a spatula, lift the cut doughnuts to wax paper or a lightly floured board.  allow them to stand in a cool place 15 minutes before frying.  The oil for frying the doughnuts should be 2 to 3 inches deep and should be heated to 365 degrees.  Lower the doughnuts, one or two at a time, into the hot oil  when they are brown on one side, turn with the aid of a spatula or tongs and brown the other side.  when nicely browned, remove to absorbent paper.  Be sure to reheat the fat to 365 degrees before adding additional doughnuts.

2 1/2	cups	uncooked converted rice                               

There's a lot of work to this, but it is well worth it.  DO NOT add more rice to this after the rice has been cooking in the oven.  I use Hungarian paprika.  It's a little spicier than normal paprika.

This is a definite crowd pleaser!

Chicken stock:

Cut onion in quarters, cut potatoes in quarters, put all stock items in large stock pot.  Fill with water and boil preferably at least 4 hours).  Fill with water as needed to keep water above stock ingredients.  Skim off grease.  Pour stock water into jars to use later.  I do all this the day before I plan on doing this recipe.  The stock will keep in the refrigerator for at least 1 week.

NOTE:  when doing this recipe it is imperative that all chopping and measuring is done BEFORE you start any of the actual cooking.  This goes pretty quickly (it at least keeps you real busy), and you won't have time to chop and dice once you begin cooking. 

NOTE: this recipe very often tastes even better the day after it is cooked.
You can add more chicken breasts if there are going to be more people.

Chop and measure all ingredients, and keep separate.  Combine all seasoning ingredients and mix thoroughly.  Makes 7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon.

Sprinkle 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons seasoning mix all over the chicken and pat it in with your hands.  (Then cut up chicken into bite-size pieces - if desired).  

Place the bacon in a 5-quart ovenproof pot over high heat.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is brown and crisp (about 10 minutes).  Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Add the seasoned chicken to the bacon fat in the pot.  Cover and cook, turning once or twice until browned on all sides (about 7 to 9 minutes).  You'll probably have to cook the chicken in 2 batches.  Remove the chicken pieces to a bowl.

Drain off all but 3 tablespoons of the fat from the pot.  Add the onions, chopped celery and bell peppers.  Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up the crust that forms on the bottom of the pot, about 2 minutes.  Stir in the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook 3 minutes.  Stir in the flour, and as soon as it turns a rich brown color and begins to stick to the bottom of the pot (which will be almost immediately, so have your stock ready) add 1 cup of the chicken stock and scrape up the crust from the bottom of the pot.  Cook, uncovered, stirring gently once or twice, until the mixture sticks to the bottom of the pot (about 2 minutes).  Add 1 cup more chicken stock, scrape the pot bottom again, and bring to a boil, stirring often.  Add the remaining 4 cups stock and the garlic, scrape the pot bottom, and cook 1 minutes.  Add the remaining seasoning mix and bring to a boil, whipping constantly with a wire whisk.  Boil, without whisking, 2 minutes, then add the carrots, sliced celery, rice and the chicken pieces and any accumulated juices.  

Bake at 350 degrees for 17 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let sit 10 minutes.  Stir in the cooked bacon and serve immediately, with a light salad.

This is an excellent main dish, and stores very well for the following day(s).

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.  Spread nuts on baking sheet and place 
in oven until toasted, 10 to 12 minutes or until they develop a toasty 
aroma.  Remove from oven and set aside to cool.  Increase oven temperature 
to 350 degrees.  Place unsweetened chocolate, 12 oz semi-sweet chocolate, 
butter, margarine and espresso in top of double boiler and place over 
simmering (not boiling) water until chocolate is about 3/4 melted. 
Meanwhile, beat the eggs with a wire whisk in a large mixing bowl. 
Gradually add sugar, whisking until mixture becomes thick and light in 
color.  When chocolate is almost melted, remove from heat and stir until 
completely melted and satiny in appearance.  Gradually whisk chocolate 
into egg mixture.  Stir with a wooden spoon to incorporate.  Sift flour, 
baking powder and salt directly into chocolate mixture.  Gently stir until 
the dry ingredients are barely incorporated.  Cut the 6 oz of semi-sweet 
chocolate into 1/2 inch chunks and stir into dough along with the toasted 
nuts.  Lightly butter 4 aluminum baking sheets.  (do not use foil or 
cookies will burn)  Drop dough by tablespoonfuls, 12 to a sheet to leave 
room for cookies to spread.  Bake only one sheet at a time in center of 
oven.  Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes, or until cookies lose 
their shine.  Cookies will still be very soft.  Allow to cool for 2 
minutes before removing from pans.  Using a pin-sized tip on an icing bag, 
pipe melted semi-sweet chocolate onto cookies in a criss-cross pattern. 
Allow to cool at least 1 hour before storing in tins.

4	slices	mozzarella cheese                                       

Note: Monterey jack cheese can be substitued for mozzarella cheese.  Also, the chicken should be boneless and skinless.  If bacon slices are thick, precook until they are transparent.

Pound chicken breasts slightly.  Beat egg and milk together in a shallow dish.  Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in another shallow dish.  Dip chicken in egg mixture and then in bread crumbs.  Place 1 slice of cheese in the middle of each breast and roll up chicken.  Wrap chicken in 1 or 2 slices of bacon.  Roll in bread crumb mixture.  Place in baking dish and bake for approximately 30 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  Drain on paper towel to absorb extra bacon droppings.

prep time: 25 minutes.

1	each	grated lemon zest                                         

Sift flour, baking powder and salt onto piece of wax paper.  Set aside.

Combine lemon zest and granulated sugar in blender or food processor.  Grind until lemon zest is almost as fine as sugar.  Cream butter and lemon sugar in mixer bowl until light and fluffy.  Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating until smooth and flowing.  Add lemon extract.  Mix to combine (curdled appearance is fine).  Add sifted dry ingredients.  Mix until smooth.  Transfer to greased 8-1/2-inch springform pan.  Smooth surface with spatula.  

Bake at 325 degrees on center rack of oven until lightly colored and wook pick inserted in center comes out clean (about 35 minutes).  

Prepare glaze by mixing powdered sugar and lemon juice.

Place hot cake in pan on cooling rack and brush surface with glaze immediately.  Let glaze run down sides of cake.  Gently rotate pan to distribute drippings evenly.  After all glaze is applied and seems absorbed, carefully remove springform rim.  As soon as cake seems cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes, transfer to platter with long spatula (aluminum cake pans can affect lemon flavor).  Let cake cool completely.  Spread lemon frosting on cooled cake.

LEMON FROSTING:

Combine powdered sugar, butter, salt, lemon zest and juice.  Add few drops of water for smooth consistency (if necessary).

For mild flavor, choose early pink rhubarb.  If tender and pink, do not peel.  Cut into 1-inch pieces. (1 pound makes 2 cups).  Amount of sugar depends on tartness of rhubarb.  Early rhubarb requires less sugar (if it is not early rhubarb,  increase sugar by up to 50 percent).  Make your pie shallow.

Mix together sugar and flour.  Then add cut-up rhubarb and mix lightly.  Pour into pastry-lined pie pan, and dot with butter.  Put crust on top of pie.  Sprinkle with sugar, and cut slits.

Bake at 425 degrees for 40 to 50 minutes, or until crust is nicely browned and juice begins to bubble through slits.

For strawberry-rhubarb pie, replace half of rhubarb with an equal amount of sliced fresh strawberries.  Also, use the minimum amount of sugar (what is listed in ingredients).

Heat oven to 350 degrees.  Lightly grease cookie sheets.

In large bowl, beat margarine and brown sugar until light and fluffy.  Add pineapple, vanilla and eggs; mix well.  Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off.  Add flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; mix well.  Stir in walnuts.  Drop teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart onto greased cookie sheets.  Bake at 350 degrees for 8 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.  Immediately remove from cookie sheets.  Cool completely.

To make frosting, place powdered sugar in small bowl.  Heat butter in heavy skillet over medium heat until golden brown, stirring frequently.  Pour into powdered sugar; stir, adding enough pineapple liquid for desired spreading consistency.  Frost cooled cookies.

NOTE:  the pineapple should be 1 can of crushed pineapple in its own juice (not heavy syrup).  Drain it well, and some of the liquid is used for the frosting.
Also, do NOT use margarine for the frosting.  It MUST be butter.

1	tsp	vanilla                                                    

Butter sides of a heavy 3-quart saucepan.  In it combine sugar, corn syrup, chocolate, and salt; stir in milk.  cook and stir over medium heat till all the sugar dissolves and the chocolate melts. (Avoid splashing the sides of pan with chocolate mixture.)  Clip a candy thermometer to side of pan.  Continue cooking over medium heat till thermometer registers 234 degrees (soft-ball stage), stirring only as necessary to prevent sticking.  (The chocolate mixture should boil gently over entire surface.)  Watch closely; the tempaerature rises quickly above 220 degrees.  If you do not have a candy thermometer, use the cold water test.  

Remove saucepan from heat; add butter.  Don't stir in the butter; simply place it on top of the mixture and let the heat melt it.  Let mixture cool, without stirring, till candy thermometer registers 110 degrees.  (At this temperature, the bottom of the pan should feel comfortably warm.)

Add vanilla.  Using a spoon, beat the mixture vigorously with an up-and-over motion for 5 to 6 minutes or till mixture is of spreading consisitency.  This is the critical step in making fudge frosting.  Be sure to check the consistency frequently so that the frosting doesn't become too stiff.  Pour and spread IMMEDIATELY atop a 13x9-inch cake.  The frosting will be smooth and satiny, but will soon become too stiff to spread.  Work quickly, using a small, metal spatula to spread frosting.  To smooth small areas that set up too fast, dip the spatula in warm water and then smooth over these areas.  

Frosts top of a 13x9-inch cake.

NOTE: if frosting is overbeaten, it can be used as fudge candy.

ICE CREAM - COMMENTS                    
ICE CREAM
1


Ice cream is basically a sweetened, flavored, frozen dairy product made with cream and milk.  The butterfat content of the dairy products makes the ice cream rich and creamy.  Butterfat is found in differing amounts in heavy cream, light cream, half-and-half, and milk.  Ice cream also contains a proportion of nonfat solids (which are found in whole, skimmed, and condensed milk) to give it body.  Eggs may be added for even more richness. Sugar or honey sweetens it.  

For the ultimate in rich, creamy ice cream, use base 1, which has the highest amount of heavy cream.  If you prefer something lighter and less caloric, increase the proportion of milk to heavy cream.  Basically, you can combine different amounts of cream and milk to suit your taste, mood, and diet.  You can make ice cream with canned evaporated milk or canned sweetened condensed milk, but this is the road of last resort.  Save it for those times when it's 20 degrees below, the wind is howling, there's three feet of snow out the front door and there's no fresh milk in the refrigerator.  

Butterfat Chart:

heavy cream . . . . . . . . .  36% butterfat

whipping cream. . . . . . . . 30 - 36%
light whipping cream. . . . .30 - 36%
medium cream. . . . . . . . ..30 - 36%

light cream. . . . . . . . . . . .18 - 30%

half-and-half . . . . . . . . . . 10.5 - 18%
coffee creamer . . . . . . . .  10.5 - 18%
coffee cereal special . . . .  10.5 - 18%

sweetened condensed milk . 9% (plus 40% additional sugar)

evaporated milk . . . . . . . . . 8% (plus 50% less water)

milk . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 4%

low-fat milk . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.5 - 2%

skim milk . . . . . . . . . . . . .  less than 0.5%

If the butterfat content is too high, your ice cream will have a waxy texture or feel to it.


Eggs: 

Most homemade ice cream has eggs or egg yolks that act as an emulsifying agent suspending the butterfat particles.  Eggs also add texture to ice cream and improve its whipping ability.  All in all, they help make a richer, creamier ice cream that holds up better in storage.  If you have personal or dietary objections to using eggs, you can maker your ice cream without them (bases 2 and 3).  Just be sure to eat it all right away, because it won't store well.


The Hidden Ingredient:

When you freeze the sweet cream base in your ice cream maker, you are adding an invisible but essential ingredient - air.  All ice cream has some amount of air.  If ice cream had no air at all, it would be a solid frozen block and totally unpalatable.

The higher the quality of the ice cream, the smaller the amount of air.  Most commercial ice creaming contain 50 percent air, which is the legal limit, and weigh 4.5 pounds per gallon.  Every spoonful of that kind of ice cream is half air, half ice cream.  Ben and Jerry's superpremium ice cream is only 20 percent air and weighs about 7.5 pounds per gallon.

In the lingo of the ice cream business, this air is called overrun.  It is stirred into the ice cream during the freezing process.  You can control the overrun in your ice cream to some extent by overfilling the canister with the sweet cream mix at the start.  Most ice cream maker manufacturer's recommend filling the canister anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 full.  If you want less air, you can fill it 3/4 full.  That means you're not going to have more than 25 percent air whipped into your ice cream.


Soft or Hard???

Fresh ice cream, whether made at home or in a factory, is initially a soft product.  You can get it harder by letting your ice cream sit longer in the ice cream maker before serving (pack ice around the canister after it is done) or by packing it in an airtight container and placing it in the freezer.  Just be aware that ice cream hardened in a home freezer tends to get icy.  

On average it will take 20 to 30 minutes to freeze your ice cream.  To get a less coarse ice cream, crush the ice to smaller pieces and use more salt.  Generally, the larger the ice chunks, the coarser the ice cream (and the longer it will take to freeze).


Fruit:

Most fruit has a high proportion of water in it, so we advise using a sweet cream mix with the highest proportion of butterfat, such as base 1.  For certain fruits, it helps quite a bit if you can prepare them in advance, sometimes just a few hours beforehand, sometimes as much as a day before.  

Usually we cut up fresh fruit, add sugar, and chill the mixture in the refrigerator in a covered bowl.  Every half hour or so, we toss the fruit.  When the fruit and sugar mingle, they combine and bring out the best in each other.  The sugar lowers the freezing point of the fruit and prevents it from becoming too icy when added to the ice cream.  the sugar also extracts the fruit's natural juices and helps flavor the ice cream during the freezing process.

1	cup	milk                                                       

Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.  Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more.  Pour in the cream and milk and whisk to blend.  Makes 1 quart.

This is the most popular of their 3 bases.  It has a creamy texture, medium body, and a subtle understated taste.  It's especially good as a background for fruit, cookies, and candy

This is the one I use..

3/4	cup	granulated sugar                                         

Pour the cream into a mixing bowl.  Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more.  Pour in the half-and-half and whisk to blend.  Makes 1 quart.

This simple recipe is made with a minimum of ingredients and requires no cooking.  It makes a very creamy ice cream with 25 percent butterfat, but it does not store well in home freezers, so be prepared to eat it all.

Melt the unsweetened chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water.  Gradually whisk in the cocoa and heat, stirring constantly, until smooth.  (The chocolate may "seize" or clump together.  Don't worry, the milk will dissolve it).  Whisk in the milk, a little at a time, and heat until completely blended.  Remove from the heat and let cool.  

Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.  Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more.  Pour in the cream and vanilla and whisk to blend.  

Pour the chocolate mixture into the cream mixture and blend.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1 to 3 hours, depending on your refrigerate.  Transfer to an ice cream maker and freeze following the manufacturer's instructions.

Makes 1 quart.

The combination of cocoa powder and unsweetened chocolate creates an ice cream with a more complex texture.

1	tsp	vanilla extract                                            

Melt the unsweetened chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot, not boiling, water.  Gradually whisk in the cocoa and heat, stirring constantly, until smooth.  (The chocolate may "seize" or clump together.  Don't worry, the milk will dissolve it.)  Whisk in the milk, a little at a time, and heat until completely blended.  Remove from the heat and let cool.

Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.  Whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1 minute more.  Pour in the cream and vanilla and whisk to blend.

Pour the chocolate mixture into the cream mixture and blend.  Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 1 to 3 hours, depending on your refrigerator.

Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and freeze following the manufacturer's instructions.

NOTE:  This recipe is slightly less rich than Ben's or Jerry's chocolate.  It acts as a good background for other flavors, especially the more subtle ones.  Try it when adding cinnamon, carob chips, malt powder, or peppermint extract.  It also provides a good showcase for peanut butter and bananas.

Chocolate Cinnamon:  add 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon into the mixture just before transferring it to the ice cream maker.

Chocolate Mint:  Add 1 teaspoon peppermint extract into the mixture just before transferring it to the ice cream maker.

1/2	cup	unsalted saltine cracker crumb                           

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients thoroughly in a small bowl.  Makes 1/4 cup.

Cook the bacon in a 10-inch skillet over high heat until brown and crispy, about 7 to 9 minutes.  If the fat starts to smoke before the bacon is brown, lower the heat to medium.  Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside.

Add the onions to the skillet and cook until the onions are golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Add the green peppers, celery, bay leaves and 2 tablespoons of the seasoning mix and cook, stirring and scraping occasionally, about 5 to 6 minutes.  Remove from the heat and remove and discard the bay leaves.

Combine the tomato juice, evaporated milk and the cooked bacon in a large bowl.  Add the cooked vegetable mixture and blend well.

Gently combine the meat, eggs and cracker crumbs in another large bowl.  Add the vegetable mixture and, being careful not to pack too tightly, incorporate everything thoroughly.

Spray a 13x9-inch loaf pan or rectangular casserole dish with cooking spray.  Turn the meat mixture into the pan and mold it into a thick loaf.  

Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, turn the pan around, and bake another 15 minutes.

NOTE:  I usually mix another ground meat instead of the veal.  Also, get all the ingredients prepared before you start cooking.

Spread chopped pecans on bottom of 8x8-inch baking pan (enough to cover bottom of pan).

Boil butter and brown sugar on medium for about 7 minutes or until it reaches about 242 degrees. Pour over pecans in pan.  Sprinkle chocolate chips and spread when melted.  Use enough chips to cover toffee.

Note:  I use a pie pan instead of the 8x8 pan.  It makes it easier to get out because the sides are sloped.

ORANGE PEEL CANDY                       
CANDY 
1

	SOURCE	COUPON NET - JOYCE                                       
8		oranges                                                       
1	cup	boiling water                                              
4	cups	granulated sugar                                          
		water                                                          

Wash the oranges; cut into halves and squeeze out the juice for some other purpose.  Place the oranges into a large saucepan and cover with cold water.  Place over high heat and heat to a boil.  Add cold water to cover again.  Heat to a boil and drain.  Repeat this process five times in all.  Drain well and scoop out the pulp.  Cut the oranges into 1/4 inch wide strips.

Combine 1 cup of boiling water with 2 cups of sugar.  Heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Stir in the orange strips.  Place over medium heat and boil for about 30 minutes, until all the liquid is evaporated.  Watch carefully so the peels don't scorch.  Cool.  Roll the strips in the remaining 2 cups of sugar.  Place on waxed paper to dry.  Package and store in airtight containers.

TIP:  Collect the orange halves over a period of time and refrigerate them in a plastic bag until you have enough to prepare candied peel.  You may candy "whole" orange halves, if you wish. Just boil them without cutting them into strips.  When cooled they make lovely containers for candies and nuts, or holiday desserts.

This recipe makes about 3 to 4 pounds.

1/8	tsp	cream of tartar                                          

Mix sugar, vinegar and water.  Boil slowly until bubbles get large (hard crack stage).  Add cream of tartar then put in buttered platter.  Let set for a couple minutes, and then pull with buttered hands.  It will still be almost hot when you begin pulling.

How to pull:  get an amount that you can handle, then pull, fold in half, and pull, etc.  It should be fairly white before the pulling is complete.  Pulling will
give it the white color, and will give it a smooth consistency.

Note:  you will get tired of pulling before it is done.

When done pulling, shape it into long pieces or curls, etc.  Place on wax paper.  When it sets and gets hard then pick up sections and break with a knife handle etc.  Then wrap in wax paper and twist ends.

3 1/2	cup	powdered sugar, sifted                                 

In a small bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the margarine and the cocoa on medium speed until the mixture is well combined (it will appear dry and crumbly).  Turn off the mixer.  Add the milk and vanilla to the bowl.  Set the mixer on medium-low and mix until combined (the mixture will appear thick, like clay).  Add the sugar in 3 parts.  (The first cup of sugar will make the mixture thinner and appear runny.  Do not worry, the frosting will thicken and become spreadable as you continue adding the sugar.)  Mix until smooth and creamy, and spread on cooled cake.

NOTE:  the cocoa should be Dutch-process

		granulated sugar                                               
		boiling water                                                  

You need a clean one-quart large mouth canning jar, piece of clean white string, a metal weight (such as a paper clip or metal washer), a pencil, and a knife or fork.

Fill the jar with sugar.  Slowly pour boiling water into the jar.  Push a kitchen knife down into the water so that the sugar gets wet all the way down to the bottom of the jar.  Add more water slowly and then stir to make sure that all of the sugar disolves.  Tie a paper clip to one end of the string.  Tie the other end to the pencil.  Place the pencil across the mouth of the jar.  Roll the string around the pencil until the weight is almost touching the bottom of the jar.  Set the uncovered jar aside undisturbed in a warm place for several days.  Crystals will grow on the string, on the jar, and on the surface of the sugar solution.  Break up the crust from time to time so that the water can evaporate.  As the water evaporates, more crystals grow.

4	cups	granulated sugar                                          
		food coloring (optional)                                       

Place water and sugar in saucepan and stir for a minute or so to dissolve as much as possible.  Cook on medium-high heat until sugar is dissolved.  Add food coloring (if desired).  Stir.  Remove from heat.  If using a Rubbermaid or Tupperware container you can pour the hot liquid directly into it.  Otherwise let the liquid cool in the suacepan; then pour into your plastic container (DO NOT use a glass container!!).  Larger crystals grow if the solution is allowed to cool slowly.  So, if possible, place container in a warm spot.

Crystals will form on the surface in a few days.  Do not remove them;  sink them to the bottom with a spoon.  In 7 days or so the bottom of the plastic container will be covered with a thick layer of sugar crystals (rock candy).  Turn the container over in the sink and let the excess sugar solution drain completely.  This takes about 2 hours.  When the surface of the crystals is dry, push on the sides and bottom of the plastic bowl and tghe crystals will break into chunks.  Put crystals onto wax paper and let them dry completely.  The more they dry, the more they sparkle.

To make about 10 ounces: 
 
Mix the sugar and cornstarch in a saucepan. Stir in the corn syrup, butter, 
water and salt.  Cook the mixture over moderate heat until it reaches 254 
deg. F. or until a few drops test in cold water form a hard ball that holds 
it shape.  Remove the pan from the heat, add a few drops of food coloring and 
flavoring, and pour the taffy onto a buttered platter.  Cool the taffy until 
it can be handled comfortably, about two to three minutes.  Butter your 
hands, and pull the taffy until it is light in color and firm enough to hold 
a shape.  Stretch it into a roll about 1 inch in diameter and snip off bits 
with oiled kitchen scissors. Wrap each piece in wax paper.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Spread the almonds out on a baking sheet.  Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly browned or until they give off an aroma.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.  Grind to a consistency resembling rough sand in a food processor or blender.  Be sure almonds are cool, or you will make almond butter.

In a medium bowl cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in the egg, then stir in the almond extract and milk.  Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt, and mix in along with the ground toasted almonds to form a soft dough. 

Refrigerate the dough for 15 to 20 minutes.  This will help the cookies keep their shape after pressing.

Ligthly grease cookie sheets, and fill cookie press with dough.  Press out cookies at least 1 inch apart depending on the size.  You can experiment with different cookie designs.  I've found most true Swedes tend to use the star shape, however, you're free to use whatever shape suits your fancy.

Bake for 8 to8 to 1010 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are lightly browned.  cool on the cookie sheets for a minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
