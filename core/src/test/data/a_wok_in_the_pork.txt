1. Heat olive oil in a non-stick wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork, gingerroot, and garlic. Cook and stir for 6 to 7 minutes, until pork is cooked through and begins to brown. Remove pork from wok and keep worm. Add green pepper, carrots, and onions to wok. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. 

2. Meanwhile, prepare sauce. Drain pineapple, reserving 1/2 cup juice. In a small bowl, combine reserved pineapple juice, ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, cornstarch, and chili powder. Add sauce to vegetables in wok, along with cooked pork and pineapple chunks. Cook until sauce is bubbly and has thickened, and pork and pineapple are heated through. Serve over hot, cooked rice.

NOTES : "Store in tight container for up to 1 week. Flavour improves after 1-2 days." 

My notes: I needed longer than recommended time, and even could have used a bit longer. Next time, try keeping in oven for 50-55 mins for first baking. Trust tester and colour, not recommended time!
